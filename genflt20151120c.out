D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]House blocks refugee program, with Dem 
D  support[/WEBHEAD]
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Jonathan Tamari[/BYLINE]
D  [BYCREDIT]INQUIRER WASHINGTON BUREAU
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROPBLUE5]W<MC>ASHINGTON — The House approved a plan 
D  Thursday to effectively stall the arrivals of Syrians and Iraqis 
D  seeking refuge in the United States, as 47 Democrats joined 
D  Republicans in a rebuke to President Obama and a sign of how the 
D  Paris terrorist attacks have stoked security fears.
D  The measure, which requires tighter screening for applicants from 
D  those countries<NO1>fleeing those <NO>, passed by 289-137, a 
D  wide-enough margin to override a promised presidential veto. The 
D  result piled pressure on Democrats in the Senate, where the bill’s 
D  fate will not be decided until after the weeklong Thanksgiving 
D  break.
D  Rep. Donald Norcross of South Jersey was among <NO1>one of <NO>
D  Democrats to break with the president and support the measure, 
D  despite a last-minute visit and appeals from Obama chief of staff 
D  Denis McDonough and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson<NO1>, 
D  who attempted to head off defections<NO>.
D  “Our first and most important job is to keep the American country 
D  safe,” Norcross said before the vote. The system for screening 
D  Syrians is “pretty good,” he said, but “the issue is, we have to 
D  have a perfect system.”
D  </MC>[/DROPBLUE5]The bill requires the FBI to certify the 
D  background investigation of each refugee from Syria and Iraq. The 
D  leaders of that agency, the Department of Homeland Security, and 
D  the director of National Intelligence also would have to certify 
D  that each refugee was not a security threat.
D  Many lawmakers question whether the United States can effectively 
D  screen people arriving from chaotic countries that lack <NO1>
D  little American presence or <NO>reliable bureaucracies or a 
D  significant American presence.
D  “We need to increase accountability,” said a statement from Rep. 
D  Ryan Costello (R., Pa.). Like him, nearly every Republican, and 
D  all of them from the Philadelphia area, backed the bill. 
D  The vote came as officials in Washington and in many statehouses 
D  sought to show the public that they are serious about security and 
D  preventing terrorism.
D  The Paris attacks also continued to roil the U.S. presidential 
D  race. Two senators running for the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz 
D  and Rand Paul, each attempted procedural moves to force votes on 
D  their own ideas for getting tougher with refugees.
D  Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading Democratic contender, laid out 
D  her own plan to fight the Islamic State, including a no-fly zone 
D  to protect Syrians, more use of Special Operations forces, and 
D  increased airstrikes.
D  Democrats say setting up the new vetting system would take so long 
D  that it would halt the intake of Syrians and Iraqis fleeing homes 
D  threatened by war and the Islamic State, the group that has 
D  claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks.
D  <NO1>“I’d rather be on the right side of history, even if that is 
D  the wrong side politically,” said Rep. Chaka Fattah (D., Pa.).
D  <NO>Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) accused 
D  Republicans who pushed the bill of “fearmongering and bigotry.”
D  “We cannot repeat the dark days of the 1930s, when many Americans 
D  resolved to turn away the helpless refugees fleeing Hitler,” Reid 
D  said, “or our imprisoning of innocent Japanese Americans during 
D  World War II.”
D  Said Rep. Chaka Fattah (D., Pa.): “I’d rather be on the right side 
D  of history, even if that is the wrong side politically.” 
D  Reid pledged that Senate Democrats would try to block the move to 
D  stop resettlements, but Republicans may have leverage.
D  With a must-pass spending bill due by Dec. 11, the GOP could 
D  attach the refugee measure to that legislation and dare Democrats 
D  to vote against it — a move that would lead to a government 
D  shutdown.
D  Administration officials <NO1>said <NO>say Syrian refugees already 
D  go through the most rigorous vetting of any foreign nationals <NO1>
D  coming <NO>coming into the U.S., an 18- to 24-month process that 
D  involves multiple agencies<NO1> and that typically takes 18 to 24 
D  months, and Obama has denounced Republicans for, in his view, 
D  slamming the door on people fleeing terrorism<NO>.
D  The House bill would “unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist 
D  some of the most vulnerable people in the world,” the White House 
D  said in its vow to veto the bill.
D  Of the 2,174 Syrian refugees who have come to the U.S. since Sept. 
D  11, 2001, none has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related 
D  grounds, the administration said. Obama wants to admit 10,000 
D  more.
D  House members <NO1>
D  “People who voted for this <NO>who supported the bill “will be 
D  able to go home to their district over Thanksgiving, act as if 
D  they were tough,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle, a first-term Democrat 
D  whose district includes Philadelphia and Montgomery County. “And 
D  yet, what we did really achieves nothing.” 
D  The bigger threat, Boyle said, comes from European citizens who 
D  become radicalized and can easily travel to the United States.
D  While at least one of the Paris attackers is believed to have 
D  traveled with Syrian refugees, it is not clear whether he was an 
D  actual refugee. Most of the other assailants were European.
D  [KERN+2]Senate Democrats hope to turn attention to that issue 
D  after Thanksgiving<NO1>, perhaps taking some of the heat off the 
D  refugee bill<NO>. On Thursday, they pledged to introduce a 
D  measure, with some Republican support, to tighten security checks 
D  on the visa waiver program, which allows visitors from 38 
D  countries — including Germany, Belgium, and France — to travel to 
D  the U.S. with less stringent screening.
D  [/KERN+2][KERN+2]A key difference is that visitors under the 
D  waiver program do not have to meet with U.S. officials abroad 
D  before coming here. Around 20 million people use the program to 
D  visit the U.S. each year. 
D  [/KERN+2]A French citizen, for example, could travel to Syria, 
D  return to France, and then travel to the U.S. under the program, 
D  said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.).
D  “Our bill will be a straightforward solution that can make a real 
D  difference,” said Feinstein, who plans to introduce the bill after 
D  the holiday. 
D  Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) has signed on as a cosponsor. Some 
D  other Republicans agree the program may pose the greater security 
D  risk.
D  <NO1>The measure could give Democrats an alternative to support in 
D  the face of GOP pressure when the debate resumes after 
D  Thanksgiving.<NO>[SHIRTTAILNEW]<SC13,43>jtamari@phillynews.com<QA0>

D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Matt Gelb
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]The name of a Fabric Row mainstay, faded on its 
D  storefront window, is hidden behind a red banner that blares: 
D  “Retirement Sale Everything <MD+,%21,%70,%70>1</MD><MD><CS4>/</CS>
D  <MD-,%0,%70,%70>2</MD><MD> Off.”
D  Marmelstein’s, in business since 1919, started with an immigrant’s 
D  door-to-door needle-and-thread sales from his knapsack. After 96 
D  years, its last day is Saturday.
D  Shoppers now roam South Fourth Street for the designer boutique, 
D  the hair salon, the bike shop, and the artisan studio that have 
D  reshaped a neighborhood once defined by textiles.
D  Across the street, a cat cafe that teases its opening with 
D  Facebook photos of “banana nutella sushi” is slated for January.
D  The fabric of the city is changing.
D  “Is this the fringe store?” a customer asked Wednesday as she 
D  entered Marmelstein’s. Yes, at least for a few more days.
D  “Sorry,” another customer said awkwardly <NO1>said <NO>after 
D  spotting the banner.
D  “Don’t be sorry,” said Judy Buchsbaum, 59<NO1>, said<NO>. “I’m 
D  retiring. I’m lucky.”
D  Fabric Row has evolved from its beginnings as a commercial 
D  district popularized by Jewish immigrants at the turn of the 20th 
D  century. 
D  Marmelstein’s, a third-generation family-owned business, is a 
D  throwback to the days of pushcarts and cobblestone. Business is 
D  slow.
D  Buchsbaum’s grandfather Abraham Marmelstein settled from Poland 
D  and swapped his knapsack for a pushcart. In 1937, he bought 760 S. 
D  Fourth St., a three-story rowhouse with ornate bay windows. 
D  Buchsbaum’s mother grew up upstairs. After family dinners, the 
D  children scampered downstairs to play with piles of buttons.
D  [KERN-2]For decades, business thrived. The family purchased more 
D  property on Fabric Row. Marmelstein’s specialized in fine bridal 
D  items, then in fringe and trim for furniture and drapes. It opened 
D  a warehouse in Grays Ferry to handle a booming wholesale 
D  operation.
D  [/KERN-2]The retail customers at Marmelstein’s were the 
D  middle-class rowhouse owners of South Philadelphia. Chubby 
D  Checker’s grandmother came for 4<TH>p.m. tea every day. Angelo 
D  Bruno’s mother, always with a different goddaughter in tow, 
D  preferred the high-end wedding goods.
D  “It used to be custom, custom, custom,” Buchsbaum said. “And now, 
D  because of the Internet and people’s expectations, they go to Bed 
D  Bath & Beyond to buy something ready-made. They want everything 
D  faster, and custom takes weeks.”
D  So Fabric Row changes. Buchsbaum, who wears a polo and jeans to 
D  work, scanned the store’s 13 bookcases, still filled with trim. 
D  Green, orange, and pink tags signal discounts of 35 or 60 percent. 
D  The ceiling’s crown molding cracks. Whatever is left, Buchsbaum 
D  said, will be sold in bulk to another fabric store. She will keep 
D  the building and lease it out, but no firm plans are set. 
D  “It won’t be the same,” said Wanda Search, an interior designer 
D  from Langhorne who has shopped at Marmelstein’s for two decades. 
D  “It wasn’t just about buying the trims and the hardware; it was 
D  about the people at Marmelstein’s, who were so helpful and dear. 
D  They’re all characters.”
D  During the success of the ‘90s, 20 employees invigorated 
D  Marmelstein’s. Three are left; they face unemployment next week. 
D  David, the salesman. Loi, the bookkeeper. </MD>Wanda in customer 
D  service.
D  David Ramos, a diminutive 48-year-old wearing a Nike cap and 
D  silver chain, greeted customers: “What’s up, sweetheart?” he said. 
D  He has worked at Marmelstein’s for 28 years with no prior 
D  knowledge of textiles. Buchsbaum taught him.
D  “She’s like a sister I never had,” Ramos said, “but she’s my 
D  boss.”
D  He will try to find another job on Fabric Row, but Fabrics on 
D  Fourth just closed, too. His brother is a certified butcher; maybe 
D  Ramos will wrap meat.
D  Buchsbaum is not one to gush. She is tired of the grind. In 
D  February, a developer offered $650,000 for Marmelstein’s warehouse 
D  on Dickinson Street. That was the tipping point.
D  As she cleaned corners of the store, Buchsbaum stumbled upon a 
D  tattered box of old Twin Brand millinery wire. Inside were 
D  100-year-old artifacts.
D  A Fancy Leather Good Workers Union member card for A. Marmelstein 
D  dated Oct. 1, 1913. Postcards, mailed in 1914 from Warsaw, written 
D  in Yiddish. A business card for a Mr. Guttenplan<NO1>cq<NO>, 
D  fashion artist.
D  Yes, Buchsbaum said, it is the end of an era. After Saturday, she 
D  will finish some orders and find a home for the remaining stock — 
D  or whatever heirlooms she uncovers.
D  Wedding portraits of Abraham and Dora Marmelstein grace the back 
D  office. Next to them hang decades-old sketches from inside the 
D  store, drawn by a relative.
D  “What life used to be,” said Mark Dillingham, Buchsbaum’s husband, 
D  as he admired them. Below, a laptop lit the room.
D  Buchsbaum considered her version of the American dream. Some 
D  sentimentality, finally, was appropriate.
D  “You know what? I’m really, really lucky,” she said. “My 
D  grandparents worked hard. My parents worked hard. That enabled 
D  them to buy property on the block. And that’s the only reason I 
D  can retire.”

D  [/BYCREDIT]Pennsylvania leads the nation — and New Jersey is 
D  fourth — in drug overdose deaths among young adult men, according 
D  to a new analysis, raising the level of urgency about an epidemic 
D  that over the last decade has killed more than twice as many 
D  Americans as homicide. 
D  Bucks and Gloucester Counties led their respective states in 
D  overdose fatality rates among males ages 19 to 25 — each of them 
D  nearly three times Philadelphia’s rate. In the eight-county 
D  region, more than 100 young men a year are dying from overdoses of 
D  both illicit and legal drugs.
D  The state numbers are included in a report on teen substance abuse 
D  released Thursday<NO1>11.20<NO> by the Trust for America’s Health. 
D  The public health nonprofit examined federal statistics for 
D  2011-13 filtered by age and sex. An Inquirer analysis did the same 
D  at the county level.
D  Pennsylvania, with 30.3 deaths per 100,000 young-adult male 
D  residents, was less than one-tenth of a point higher than No. 2 
D  New Mexico.
D  But when all ages and genders are combined, Pennsylvania ranks 
D  ninth, with a death rate that is two-thirds that of the worst 
D  state, West Virginia. New Jersey’s overall rate is below the 
D  national average.
D  The difference has to do with the far-higher overdose rates in 
D  middle age. But state-by-state variations depend on numerous 
D  factors, including occupation. For instance, West Virginia 
D  disability-claims records suggest many coal miners were prescribed 
D  addictive painkillers.
D  The new report focuses on teens and young adults, to make the 
D  point that stepped-up prevention efforts when youngsters are still 
D  in high school could have a major impact on deaths later on. 
D  Overdose fatality rates for ages 12 to 18 are one-tenth those of 
D  young adults.
D  “The opportunity to do prevention work is when they are still in 
D  school, that captive audience,” Jeffrey Levi, the foundation’s 
D  executive director, said in an interview.
D  Patterns of drug use as teens transition into adulthood are not 
D  well understood, Brian Bumbarger, a founding director of the 
D  EPISCenter<NO1>cq<NO> at Pennsylvania State University, said 
D  Thursday.
D  The report praised the work of Bumbarger’s center (the acronym 
D  stands for Evidence-based Prevention and Intervention Support<NO1> 
D  Center<NO>), a statewide collaboration of several agencies and 
D  efforts. It also scored states on how many of 10 recommended 
D  policies they had adopted, from bullying prevention to 
D  mental-health funding. New Jersey was one of only two states with 
D  a perfect 10; Pennsylvania was above average with seven.
D  The indicators mainly seemed to indicate how little is known about 
D  teen addiction.
D  But why would young adults in Pennsylvania be any different from 
D  those elsewhere? And what explains the higher rates in the 
D  suburbs? Bucks, Montgomery, and Delaware Counties all have much 
D  higher fatality rates than Philadelphia (Chester County is also 
D  lower). Gloucester, Camden, and Burlington Counties are above the 
D  New Jersey average.
D  Jeanine M. Buchanich<NO1>cq<NO>, who studies overdose data at the 
D  University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public Health, said 
D  that patterns in some parts of Pennsylvania seem to be an 
D  extension of neighboring Appalachian states, where prescription 
D  painkiller addiction is greatest.
D  Over the last decade, painkillers have become a major gateway to 
D  heroin. Some people who are addicted to synthetic prescription 
D  opioids move on to the substance derived from opium poppies to 
D  avoid withdrawal sickness when they can no longer afford the 
D  pricier pain pills.
D  Buchanich cited a couple of reasons for the suburban death rates. 
D  One is essentially the result of “competing risk”: Philadelphia 
D  loses so many young men through homicide that overdose rates are 
D  lower.
D  The other, which she attributed to research by the journalist Sam 
D  Quinones<NO1>cq<NO> for his recent book [ITALIC]Dreamland: The 
D  True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic[/ITALIC], is that Mexican 
D  drug importers years ago targeted suburban areas, where painkiller 
D  use was already high, in an effort to avoid urban drug gangs.
D  Overdose deaths have leveled off in some parts of the country in 
D  recent years. “Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is not one of those 
D  places so far,” said Buchanich, who has seen more recent data than 
D  what were used for the new report on teens and young adults.
D  A separate, just-released<NO1>11.2015<NO> Drug Enforcement 
D  Administration analysis of overdose fatalities in Pennsylvania 
D  noted that some of the cheapest and purest heroin in the nation 
D  passes through Philadelphia. Extremely potent heroin can be 
D  snorted or taken orally.
D  Roland Lamb, director of Philadelphia’s Office of Addiction 
D  Services, pointed to a report that “heroin tablets” disguised 
D  as[TEXT] the prescription opioid [/TEXT]oxycodone, complete with 
D  similar markings, had been seized in New Jersey last year<NO1>
D  2014<NO>.
D  “The idea is that with swallowing, you have less of an aversion” 
D  compared with injecting it, he said.
D  A decade ago, Mike<NO1>/cqcqcq, the photo caption was submitted as 
D  Michael/<NO> Pelone started taking OxyContin and Percocet that he 
D  purchased on the street while living in Bucks and Montgomery 
D  Counties.
D  A 2005 graduate of Wissahickon High School<NO1>/we have high 
D  school graduation photo/<NO>, he went through rehab three times. 
D  In August 2010, after 90 days of sobriety, “he scored some heroin, 
D  got high, and died,” said his father, Michael J. Pelone. He was 
D  23.
D  Despite the tragic end to a five-year struggle, Pelone said, 
D  Mike’s family had learned to accept his addiction as a form of 
D  chronic disease, as the medical profession has in recent decades. 
D  He wishes everybody would.
D  “There are no annual parades or ribbons to wear for them,” Pelone 
D  said. “Just a robust stigma remains, with plenty of ‘what ifs’ and 
D  ‘whys’ from the folks who know so little of drug addiction.”

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]ASSOCIATED PRESS
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROPBLUE5]P<MC>ARIS — French investigators tracked 
D  down the alleged ringleader of last week’s Paris bloodshed after 
D  receiving a startling tipoff: The Islamic militant wasn’t in Syria 
D  but in Europe, plotting yet another attack. A discarded cellphone 
D  found near a bloodied concert hall led them to his cousin, and 
D  then to a suburban Paris apartment where both died in a hail of 
D  bullets and explosions. 
D  As a manhunt intensified Thursday for a fugitive connected to the 
D  carnage, details emerged about the intelligence operation that 
D  allowed authorities to zero in on Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the 
D  Belgian<WC> <WC1>Moroccan extremist they say orchestrated the 
D  attacks in Paris and four plots thwarted earlier this year. 
D  </MC>[/DROPBLUE5]The narrative provided by French officials raised 
D  questions about how a wanted militant suspected of involvement in 
D  multiple plots could slip into Europe undetected. 
D  Investigators quickly identified Abaaoud as the architect of the 
D  deadly attacks in Paris, but they believed he had coordinated the 
D  assaults against a soccer stadium, cafes<WC>,<WC1> and a rock 
D  concert from the battlefields of Syria. 
D  That situation changed profoundly <WC>on<WC1> Monday, when France 
D  received a tip from a non-European country that Abaaoud had 
D  slipped into Europe through Greece, Interior Minister Bernard 
D  Cazeneuve said. 
D  “It was a big surprise when the intelligence came in,” said a 
D  police official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “There were 
D  many people who didn’t take it seriously, but effectively it was 
D  confirmed.” 
D  As it turned out, not only was Abaaoud in Europe, but right in 
D  front of the noses of French investigators, a 15-minute walk from 
D  the Stade de France stadium where three suicide bombers had blown 
D  themselves up during the Nov. 13 attacks. 
D  “We have strong reason to believe that this cell was about to 
D  commit massive terror attacks in France,” Prime Minister Manuel 
D  Valls said Thursday, speaking on public broadcaster France 2. 
D  Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Abaaoud was traced to the 
D  apartment in Saint-Denis through phone taps and surveillance. 
D  Two police officials briefed on the investigation <WC>said <WC1>
D  that a cellphone dumped in a trash can outside the Bataclan 
D  concert hall — where 89 people were killed — proved crucial. It 
D  contained a text message sent about 20 minutes after the massacre 
D  began that read: “We’re off, it’s started.” 
D  [SUBHED_1]<WC>Contact information
D  [/SUBHED_1]<WC1>The phone had contact information for Abaaoud’s 
D  cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen, <WC>26, said <WC1>one of the police 
D  officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
D  Both she and Abaaoud were killed as heavily armed SWAT teams 
D  raided the apartment in Saint-Denis early Wednesday, prosecutors 
D  said.
D  Her final moments were marked by a brief, angry exchange with 
D  police before she is believed to have detonated a suicide vest.
D  [KERN-1]An audio recording, confirmed by a police official, 
D  captured the exchange. As gunshots rang out, an officer was heard 
D  shouting: “Where is your boyfriend?” 
D  [/KERN-1]“He’s not my boyfriend!” Aitboulahcen responded angrily. 
D  Then a loud explosion was heard, which police officials said was 
D  the bomb in her vest detonating.
D  [KERN-2]Prosecutors said Thursday that a fingerprint check had 
D  confirmed that another mangled body found inside the heavily 
D  damaged building was that of Abaaoud. <WC>The raids yielded the 
D  arrests of e<WC1>ight people, including two who were pulled out of 
D  the rubble.
D  [/KERN-2]Authorities initially gave Abaaoud’s age as 27, but on 
D  Thursday, Paris prosecutors said he was 28.
D  <NO1>“Abaaoud played a decisive role in these attacks,” Cazeneuve 
D  said. “The investigation will establish precisely how this 
D  Belgo-Moroccan was involved.” 
D  <NO>[SUBHED_1]<WC>Thwarted attacks
D  [/SUBHED_1]<WC1>Abaaoud was also believed to be behind four of six 
D  attacks thwarted this year, including on a church in the Paris 
D  suburb of Villejuif that was foiled when the would-be attacker 
D  shot himself in the foot. French authorities are investigating <WC>
D  whether<WC1> Abaaoud was involved in an attempted attack on a 
D  high-speed train, where three young Americans tackled a heavily 
D  armed man, Cazeneuve said. 
D  In addition, he was suspected of links to two jihadis returning to 
D  Europe from Turkey, and a “wannabe jihadi” who upon his arrest in 
D  August told French intelligence that he had been recruited by 
D  Abaaoud to carry out a “violent act” in France or another European 
D  country, the interior minister said. 
D  Abaaoud is believed to have gotten to know some of the attackers 
D  responsible for the Paris massacre in the Moleenbeek neighborhood 
D  of Brussels where he grew up, including Brahim Abdeslam<WC>,<WC1> 
D  who blew himself up outside a cafe in one of Paris’ trendiest 
D  neighborhoods. Abdeslam’s brother Salah is still being sought as a 
D  suspected accomplice.
D  Authorities in Belgium on Thursday launched six raids in Molenbeek 
D  and other areas of Brussels linked to another of the suicide 
D  bombers, Bilal Hadfi, a French citizen who blew himself up outside 
D  the soccer stadium. An official in the Belgian federal 
D  prosecutor’s office said the raids targeted people in Hadfi’s 
D  “entourage.” 
D  How and when Abaaoud entered France<NO1> before his death<NO><WC> 
D  <WC1>remained unclear. He had bragged in the Islamic State’s 
D  English-language magazine that he was able to slip in and out of 
D  Europe undetected.
D  Abaaoud was wanted in Belgium, where he was sentenced in absentia 
D  this year to 20 years’ imprisonment for serving as an IS recruiter 
D  and kidnapping his younger brother, Younes. Belgian authorities 
D  say Abaaoud brought the boy, then 13, to Syria last year to join 
D  him in IS-controlled territory. 
D  [KERN-1]News of Abaaoud’s death seemed to ease some tension in a 
D  country<WC> still<WC1> <WC>reeling from<WC1> the attacks, though 
D  officials said the aftermath was far from over.
D  [/KERN-1][KERN-0]Meanwhile, Italian authorities were searching for 
D  five people flagged by the FBI in connection with a U.S. State 
D  Department warning Wednesday that St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, 
D  Milan’s cathedral and La Scala opera house, as well as churches, 
D  synagogues, restaurants, theaters<WC>,<WC1> and hotels<WC>,<WC1> 
D  had been identified as “potential targets.” 
D  [/KERN-0]<NO1>“We now know that Abaaoud, the brain behind these 
D  attacks — one of the brains, because we must be particularly 
D  cautious, and we know what the threats are — was among the dead,” 
D  Prime Minister Manuel Valls told the lower house of the French 
D  Parliament. 
D  He spoke as lawmakers voted to extend a state of emergency for 
D  three months. The measure now goes to the Senate, where it likely 
D  will be approved. The state of emergency expands police powers to 
D  carry out arrests and searches, and allows authorities to forbid 
D  the movement of people and vehicles at specific times and places. 
D  
D  Valls had pressed for the extension, and warned Thursday that an 
D  attack using “chemical or biological weapons” could not be ruled 
D  out, though he did not mention a specific threat. 
D  France requested a meeting of European interior and justice 
D  ministers Friday in Brussels to discuss the fight against 
D  terrorism. “Everyone must understand that it is urgent for Europe 
D  to recover, get organized and defend itself against the terrorist 
D  threat,” Cazeneuve said. 
D  French President Francois Hollande was going to Washington and 
D  Moscow next week to push for a stronger international coalition 
D  against IS. 
D  French military spokesman Col. Gilles Jaron said Thursday that 
D  French forces have destroyed 35 Islamic State targets in Syria 
D  since the attacks on Paris.

D  [WEBHEAD]Fiorina in Phila.: ‘Bloated’ government stifling 
D  innovation[/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Matthew Nussbaum
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]Calling the federal government “inept” and “bloated,” 
D  Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina told a 
D  Philadelphia audience Thursday that the country’s “secret sauce” 
D  of innovation and entrepreneurship is at risk of being destroyed 
D  by government overreach.
D  “We are making entrepreneurship excessively difficult in this 
D  country,” Fiorina said to about 100 people at the University of 
D  Pennsylvania. “We have become a nation of rules, not a nation of 
D  laws.”
D  Fiorina spoke at the Keystone Conference on Business and Policy, 
D  hosted by Keystone Business magazine, a Philadelphia-based 
D  publication started this year. She sounded familiar campaign 
D  themes of what she calls government incompetence and corruption.
D  The nation was founded on the idea that every individual has a 
D  right to fulfill his or her potential and <NO1>that <NO>“that 
D  right comes from God,” she said.
D  “That political idea got translated into an economic idea called 
D  entrepreneurship and innovation,” she said. “It is the economic 
D  translation of a visionary political idea.”
D  [KERN-2]Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard who lost a 2010 
D  Senate bid in California and has never held elective office, is 
D  running for the nomination as an “outsider.”
D  [/KERN-2]Two other candidates who have never held elective office 
D  — businessman Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson — 
D  are leading in the GOP polls. Fiorina has failed to gain traction 
D  despite debate performances that have garnered positive reviews. 
D  She is polling eighth nationally, with 3 percent of Republicans 
D  supporting her in an aggregation of recent national polls. Fiorina 
D  has similarly low numbers in the early-voting states of Iowa and 
D  New Hampshire.
D  [KERN-2]During a Q&A following the speech, Penn freshman Christian 
D  Petrillo asked how Fiorina might address student-loan debt.
D  [/KERN-2]“This is how socialism starts,” Fiorina responded, 
D  deploying a line she’s used in debates, arguing that the federal 
D  government created the debt crisis and should not try to solve it.
D  
D  “I thought it was a really clear answer,” said Petrillo after the 
D  speech. He said he’d “probably” vote for Fiorina.
D  Stephen Galati, a Philadelphia lawyer in attendance, praised 
D  Fiorina’s speech but acknowledged her low standing in the polls. 
D  “It’s a big field and people haven’t focused yet,” he said.
D  Fiorina was asked by an NBC reporter as she left the auditorium 
D  how she would handle Syrian refugees already in the United States 
D  — a topic of political controversy lately after some politicians 
D  linked the Paris terror attacks to the flood of refugees from 
D  Syria.
D  Fiorina ignored the question, an awkward silence hanging as aides 
D  hustled her into a waiting SUV and shut the door.
D  <NO1>Democrats took Fiorina’s visit as a chance to assail the 
D  candidate.
D  The Penn Democrats, a student group, released a statement that 
D  said Fiorina was welcome on campus, but asked attendees of the 
D  speech to note the layoffs that took place at HP under Fiorina and 
D  accused her of making “bald-faced lies about Planned Parenthood.”

D  <NO>[/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]<NO1><WC1>Sanders: Why I’m a ’democratic 
D  socialist’ and why that’s good
D  <NO>[/WEBHEAD][BYLINE]By David Lightman
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]McCLATCHY WASHINGTON BUREAU
D  [/BYCREDIT]WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders calls himself a democratic 
D  socialist. A lot of voters call that unacceptable, so <WC>on <WC1>
D  Thursday, he offered a passionate explanation of why he wears that 
D  label, saying he’s carrying on the legacy of Franklin D. 
D  Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson<WC>,<WC1> and <WC>the Rev. Dr. <WC1>
D  Martin Luther King Jr. 
D  Sanders, a senator from Vermont who trails Hillary <WC>Rodham <WC1>
D  Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination, faces deep 
D  skepticism over his political brand. Half of the voters in the 
D  latest McClatchy-Marist poll, for example, say they definitely 
D  would vote against a socialist. 
D  If the word conjures images of communists and the Soviet Union, 
D  Sanders insisted his democratic socialism is a vibrant American 
D  tradition. <WC>
D  <WC1>His program, he said, “builds on what Franklin Delano 
D  Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for 
D  all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King Jr. said 
D  in 1968 when he stated that <WC>‘<WC1>this country has socialism 
D  for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.’<WC><TH><WC1>
D  ” 
D  Remember, Sanders said of FDR during a speech at Georgetown 
D  University, “Almost everything he proposed was called socialist.”
D  Sanders recalled the New Deal, which Roosevelt crafted to revive 
D  the nation’s economy and spirit during the Great Depression of the 
D  1930s. Social Security, unemployment insurance, abolishing child 
D  labor, strong financial institution regulations and other programs 
D  that put millions to work were all regarded as socialist in their 
D  time, Sanders said. 
D  “Yet, these programs have become the fabric of our nation and the 
D  foundation of the middle class,” he said. 
D  Sanders needs a political boost. He surged this summer and fall as 
D  the chief alternative to Clinton but remains far behind. The 
D  latest McClatchy-Marist poll had Clinton up 22 percentage points 
D  nationally, about the same margin as in Iowa, the nation’s first 
D  caucus state. 
D  Sanders has tried recently to draw more contrast with Clinton, but 
D  he largely refrained Thursday. “I’m not running for president 
D  because it is my turn,” he said, “but because it’s the turn of all 
D  of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity not for some, 
D  not for the few, but for all.” 
D  <NO1>Sanders offered both history lessons and specific policy 
D  proposals. When President Lyndon Johnson signed into law 
D  legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, his 
D  initiatives were “derided by the right wing as socialist programs 
D  that were a threat to our American way of life.” 
D  Since then, even as government’s role in trying to eradicate 
D  poverty and end discrimination grew and became more accepted, 
D  “tens of millions of American families continue today to lack the 
D  basic necessities of life, while millions more struggle every day 
D  to provide a minimal standard of living for their families,” 
D  Sanders said. 
D  The fault lies with both parties, he said. “For the last 40 
D  years,” the senator <WC>explained<WC1>, “under Republican 
D  leadership and Democratic leadership, the great middle class of 
D  this country has been in decline and faith in our political system 
D  is now extremely low.” 
D  <NO>The solution<WC>, he said,<WC1> is to create a culture “which, 
D  as Pope Francis reminds us, cannot just be based on the worship of 
D  money.” 
D  He came to an audience enthusiastic to hear him. Some began lining 
D  up for the midafternoon speech before dawn.

D  Hillary Clinton calls for increased US ground forces to combat 
D  Islamic State
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By David Lauter
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]TRIBUNE WASHINGTON BUREAU
D  [/BYCREDIT]WASHINGTON — The U<WC>nited <WC1>S<WC>tates<WC1> needs 
D  to “intensify and broaden” its effort against Islamic State 
D  militants in Syria and Iraq, including sending more ground forces, 
D  Hillary <WC>Rodham <WC1>Clinton said Thursday in a speech that set 
D  out clear differences with the Obama administration as well as the 
D  Republican presidential field. 
D  “A more effective air campaign is necessary, but not sufficient,” 
D  Clinton said. “We should be honest that to be successful, 
D  airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces” to take 
D  back the territory that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or 
D  ISIL, has conquered in Syria and Iraq. 
D  Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential 
D  nomination, said she agreed with President Obama that the U.S. 
D  should not “again have 100,000 American troops in combat in the 
D  Middle East.” 
D  “If we have learned anything from 15 years of war in Iraq and 
D  Afghanistan, it’s that local people and nations have to secure 
D  their own communities,” she said. 
D  But, she added, the U.S. needs to “be prepared to deploy more” 
D  special<WC>-<WC1>operations forces than Obama has authorized and 
D  give U.S. troops currently in Iraq more leeway to embed with Iraqi 
D  units engaged in combat. 
D  Clinton also repeated her call for establishing so-called no-fly 
D  zones in northern Syria along the Turkish border, which Obama has 
D  rejected, as recently as this week. A no-fly zone would be a 
D  “strategic opportunity” that would reduce the refugee crisis in 
D  Europe by giving Syrians fleeing the country’s civil war a haven, 
D  she said. It would also give the U.S. additional “leverage” in 
D  negotiations with Russia, Turkey and other nations aimed at ending 
D  Syria’s civil war, which is now in its fifth year. 
D  Clinton also said she believes that Russian President Vladimir 
D  Putin may be prepared to cooperate more with the U.S. effort 
D  against the Islamic State, which has taken responsibility for 
D  blowing up a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula late last 
D  month. And she held out what appeared to be an incentive for 
D  Russian involvement, saying that the U.S. needs to “prioritize” 
D  the fight against the Islamic State over the effort to remove from 
D  power Syrian President Bashar <WC>al-<WC1>Assad, a Russian ally. 
D  “There is not going to be a successful military effort at this 
D  point to overturn Assad,” Clinton said. “So our efforts should be 
D  focused on ISIS,” which she described as the “common enemy.” 
D  <NO1>The Obama administration has been skeptical of Russia’s 
D  willingness to help in the effort against Islamic State and has 
D  worried that a public acknowledgment that Assad might remain in 
D  power, even for a transitional period, would alienate Sunni Arab 
D  allies such as Saudi Arabia, which sees Assad as a client of Iran. 
D  
D  Clinton also sharply criticized Republicans who have called for 
D  blocking Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. or allowing only 
D  Christian refugees in. 
D  “We cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our 
D  values,” she said. “Turning away orphans, applying a religious 
D  test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every 
D  Syrian refugee, that is just not who we are. We are better than 
D  that,” she said.

D  Ben Carson: Refugee program must screen for ’mad dogs’
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Bill Barrow
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]ASSOCIATED PRESS
D  [/BYCREDIT]MOBILE, Ala. — Republican presidential candidate Ben 
D  Carson said Thursday that blocking potential terrorists posing as 
D  Syrian refugees from entering the <WC>United States<WC1> is akin 
D  to handling a rabid dog. 
D  At campaign stops in Alabama, Carson said <WC>that <WC1>halting 
D  Syrian resettlement in the U.S. doesn’t mean America lacks 
D  compassion. 
D  “If there’s a rabid dog running around in your neighborhood, 
D  you’re probably not going to assume something good about that 
D  dog,” Carson told reporters at one stop. “It doesn’t mean you hate 
D  all dogs, but you’re putting your intellect into motion.” 
D  Carson said that to “protect my children,” he would “call the 
D  humane society and hopefully they can come take this dog away and 
D  create a safe environment once again.” 
D  He continued: “By the same token, we have to have in place 
D  screening mechanisms that allow us to determine who the mad dogs 
D  are, quite frankly. Who are the people who want to come in here 
D  and hurt us and want to destroy us?” 
D  He later repeated the comparison at a rally at the University of 
D  South Alabama, while telling hundreds of supporters that reporters 
D  had misrepresented his earlier remarks. “This is the kind of thing 
D  that they do,” he said, drawing laughs and applause. 
D  Carson is among the GOP hopefuls who have called for closing the 
D  nation’s borders to Syrian refugees <WC>following<WC1> the attacks 
D  in Paris that killed 129 people and wounded hundreds more. <NO1>
D  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the carnage, 
D  stoking fears of future attacks across Europe and in the U.S.<NO> 
D  
D  <NO1>The retired neurosurgeon, who is near the top of many 
D  national and early state preference polls, said he’s been in touch 
D  with House GOP leaders about their efforts to establish new 
D  hurdles for Syrian and Iraqi refugees trying to enter the U.S. 
D  <NO>The Council on American-Islamic relations condemned Carson’s 
D  dog comparisons at the same time it blasted another GOP hopeful, 
D  Donald Trump, for declining to rule out setting up a U.S. 
D  government data<WC><WC1>base and special identification cards for 
D  Muslims in America. 
D  “Such extremist rhetoric is un<WC><WC1>becoming of anyone who 
D  seeks our nation’s highest office and must be strongly repudiated 
D  by leaders from across the political spectrum,” said Robert 
D  McCaw’s, CAIR’s government affairs manager. 
D  <NO1>In Mobile, Carson said, “Islam itself is not necessarily our 
D  adversary.” But he said Americans are justified in seeing threats 
D  from Muslim refugees and the U.S. shouldn’t “completely change who 
D  we are as Americans just so we can look like good people.” 
D  He continued: “We have an American culture, and we have things 
D  that we base our values and principles on. I, for one, am not 
D  willing to give all those things away just so I can be politically 
D  correct.” 
D  Separately, Carson said Thursday that Islamic State militants are 
D  more organized and sophisticated than the al-Qaida terrorists who 
D  carried out the 9/11 attacks. 
D  Those attacks, he said, “really didn’t require a great deal of 
D  sophistication because we weren’t really paying attention.” 
D  He added, “You didn’t have to be that great. You had to be able to 
D  fly a couple of planes. You’re going to have to be a lot more 
D  sophisticated than that now.”

D  Stimulant medications might make military members more susceptible 
D  to PTSD
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Alan Zarembo
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]LOS ANGELES TIMES
D  [/BYCREDIT][KERN-2]Stimulant medications used to treat attention 
D  deficit problems and keep service members alert during long 
D  stretches of combat might increase vulnerability to post-traumatic 
D  stress disorder, a new study suggests. 
D  [/KERN-2]Defense Department researchers analyzing data from nearly 
D  26,000 service members found that those with prescriptions for the 
D  stimulants were five times more likely to have PTSD. 
D  [KERN-3]Drugs such as Adderall and Rit<WC><WC1>alin raise 
D  concentrations of the brain chemical norepinephrine, which has 
D  been shown to result in more vivid and persistent memories of 
D  emotionally charged situations. [/KERN-3]Traumatic memories are a 
D  hallmark of PTSD. 
D  [KERN-1]“When you take a stimulant, you enhance learning,” said 
D  Richard Friedman, a psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medical College 
D  in New York, who was not part of the study. “PTSD is <WC>a <WC1>
D  form of learning. Traumatic experiences hijack circuits in the 
D  brain.” 
D  [/KERN-1][KERN-2]In a 2012 column for <WC>t<WC1>he New York Times, 
D  Friedman wrote that the drugs were compounding the psychological 
D  damage of the wars. Studies show that 12 percent of service 
D  members in infantry units during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq 
D  developed PTSD. 
D  [/KERN-2][KERN-2]For the new study, published this month in the 
D  Journal of Traumatic Stress, researchers started with 25,971 
D  active-duty troops who screened negative for PTSD and followed 
D  them from 2001 to 2008. 
D  [/KERN-2]The subjects are part of the Pentagon’s Millennium Cohort 
D  Study, which will track the mental health of service members for 
D  the next several decades. 
D  [KERN-3]Of the 131 service members who were prescribed stimulants 
D  over the course of the study, 20 <WC>of them <WC1>— or 15 percent 
D  — also had PTSD. Controlling for a variety of socioeconomic, 
D  demographic<WC>,<WC1> and health factors, the researchers found 
D  that was five times the rate for everybody else. Overall, there 
D  were 1,215 cases of PTSD. 
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-3]Those who had been prescribed multiple stimulants 
D  and the biggest supplies of the drugs were the most likely to have 
D  PTSD. 
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-2]The results did not prove that the drugs caused 
D  the disorder. In the majority of cases, the data did not tell 
D  researchers whether the prescriptions preceded the onset of PTSD. 
D  
D  [/KERN-2]<NO1>Other factors might help explain the results, 
D  experts not involved in the study said. For example, the 
D  researchers did not control for traumatic brain injuries, which 
D  are sometimes treated with stimulants to improve cognitive 
D  function. 
D  Charles Hoge, a psychiatrist at the Walter Reed Army Institute of 
D  Research who was not involved in the study, says that more 
D  research is needed but that he does not believe the drugs played 
D  much of a role in overall rates of PTSD. “The vast majority of 
D  people with PTSD did not receive stimulants,” he said. 
D  Rachel Yehuda, a PTSD researcher at New York’s Icahn School of 
D  Medicine at Mount Sinai who was not part of the new study, said 
D  the results raise questions about whether service members with a 
D  history of attention disorders should be assigned to the 
D  battlefield. 
D  While they are “likely to thrive in the organizing context of 
D  structured military training, we need to recognize that they are 
D  more vulnerable under the chaotic conditions of combat,” she said.

D  [/BYCREDIT]Much to the worry of public health officials, new 
D  national data show that cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea<WC>,<WC1> 
D  and syphilis are climbing in the United States and have reached an 
D  all-time high. 
D  A report released this week from the U.S. Centers for Disease 
D  Control and Prevention shows that though rates of these sexually 
D  transmitted diseases fluctuated over the last five years, all 
D  three spiked in 2014. The center called the increases “alarming.” 
D  
D  “America’s worsening STD epidemic is a clear call for better 
D  diagnosis, treatment<WC>,<WC1> and prevention,” said Jonathan 
D  Mermin, director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral 
D  Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention. 
D  The volume of chlamydia cases last year was particularly 
D  staggering. Nationwide, there were about 1.4 million cases, which 
D  is the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever 
D  reported to the CDC.
D  Here’s the prevalence of those diseases in the U.S. in 2014: 
D  [RD_BULLETS]Chlamydia: 456 cases per 100,000 people 
D  Gonorrhea: 111 cases per 100,000 people 
D  Primary and secondary syphilis: <WC>6<WC1> cases per 100,000 
D  people 
D  [/RD_BULLETS]“STDs are a substantial health challenge facing the 
D  United States,” a CDC report summary says. “Each of these 
D  infections is a potential threat to an individual’s immediate and 
D  long-term health and well-being.” 
D  Chlamydia and gonorrhea are common and curable diseases, but if 
D  not treated can cause serious problems such as infertility in 
D  women. Officials estimate that undiagnosed STDs cause 20,000 women 
D  in the country to become infertile each year.
D  More than half of chlamydia and gonorrhea cases are among people 
D  between the ages of 15 and 24. Officials recommend that sexually 
D  active women under 25 be tested annually for these diseases.
D  Syphilis, which is also curable, can lead to complications such as 
D  blindness if allowed to progress.
D  Health officials recommend using condoms during sex to prevent the 
D  spread of these diseases.

D  Portrait of Rhode Island ex-mayor, felon Cianci unveiled
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Michelle R. Smith
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]ASSOCIATED PRESS
D  [/BYCREDIT]PROVIDENCE, R.I. — A portrait of former mayor and 
D  two-time felon Buddy Cianci was unveiled at City Hall on Thursday, 
D  and Cianci couldn’t resist telling a one-liner referring to his 
D  criminal past. 
D  “It’s not the first time I’ve been framed,” Cianci cracked to an 
D  overflow crowd of cheering supporters. 
D  The portrait includes references to some of Cianci’s triumphs as 
D  Providence mayor, including a book about the Providence 
D  Renaissance, when the city’s downtown was revitalized. It also 
D  shows Cianci with a full head of hair. He was known for wearing a 
D  toupee in office but now refers to it as “the squirrel.” 
D  Cianci, who spent 21 years in office and is the city’s 
D  longest-serving mayor, noted he had only been back to City Hall 
D  once since he left office in 2002 and that was a brief visit to 
D  register to vote. He said after the ceremony that Thursday’s visit 
D  filled him with nostalgia. 
D  “For some reason, it looks smaller,” he said. 
D  Cianci was forced from office twice, first in 1984, when he 
D  pleaded no contest to assaulting a man with a fireplace log, an 
D  ashtray and a lit cigarette. His second administration ended in 
D  2002 with a 4<MD+,%21,%70,%70><WC>1<MD><CS4>/</CS><MD-,%0,%70,%70>
D  2<MD><WC1>-year federal prison term for racketeering conspiracy. 
D  He attempted a comeback bid for mayor as an independent last year 
D  but lost to Jorge Elorza, a Democrat and political novice. 
D  City Hall already featured portraits of all the mayors before 
D  Cianci. The Cianci portrait was privately funded and presented 
D  during a ceremony sponsored by the city archivist’s office. Elorza 
D  was notably absent. A spokesman said he was invited but had a 
D  scheduling conflict. 
D  <NO1>When asked what Elorza thought about hanging Cianci’s 
D  portrait in City Hall, spokesman Evan England first referred calls 
D  to the archivist and the City Council. When pressed for Elorza’s 
D  opinion about it, England did not comment. 
D  City reference archivist Britni Gorman said the office was focused 
D  on tradition and was not concerned about Cianci’s criminal 
D  history. 
D  “For us, it doesn’t matter,” Gorman said. “We carry the tradition 
D  of putting up these portraits.” 
D  The celebration came to an abrupt end when Cianci, 74, was 
D  overcome by the heat in the packed room and had to sit down. An 
D  ambulance was called as a precaution, and Cianci was hospitalized 
D  briefly Thursday night. 
D  His former campaign manager, Cyd McKenna, said he did not collapse 
D  or lose consciousness. 
D  “He was just hot and understandably woozy,” she said. “He’s fine.” 
D  
D  Cianci, who hosts a daily talk radio show, was treated for cancer 
D  last year.

D  Several Moves This Week<QA0>
D  Aimed at Drug Overdoses 
E  CONTENTS
D  {TEXT}
D  [BOLD]Thursday’s<NO1>19 <NO> report,[/BOLD] “Reducing Teen 
D  Substance Misuse: What Really Works,” comes amid a flurry of 
D  activity to combat overdoses. 
D  [BOLD]The Food and Drug Administration[/BOLD] on Wednesday<NO1>
D  18<NO> approved a nasal-spray version of the opioid 
D  overdose-reversal medication naloxone, which is increasingly being 
D  carried by police and other first responders and is known as 
D  Narcan.
D  [BOLD]The Pennsylvania Health Department[/BOLD] recently announced 
D  a “standing order” for the medication, essentially meaning that 
D  pharmacies can provide it without a prescription to families and 
D  friends of people who are at risk of overdose. New Jersey allows 
D  this as well.
D  [BOLD]The American Medical Association[/BOLD] on Tuesday<NO1>
D  17<NO> called for a ban on direct-to-consumer advertising for 
D  prescription drugs and implantable medical devices, arguing that 
D  they are a factor in increasing health-care costs and encouraging 
D  patient demands for inappropriate treatment. Research shows that 
D  prescription pain relievers are not effective for chronic pain, 
D  but they are heavily advertised and frequently prescribed by 
D  doctors.
D  [BOLD]Federal advertising restrictions[/BOLD] were loosened in 
D  1997, and drug sales soared over the next decade. New Zealand is 
D  the only other country that allows prescription medication 
D  commercials on television with minimal regulation.
D  [BOLD]Also on Tuesday<NO1>17<NO>,[/BOLD] the Obama administration 
D  released its 2015 National Drug Control Strategy. It encourages 
D  Congress to permit Medicare to review and restrict inappropriate 
D  prescribing. Private insurance companies and state Medicaid 
D  programs have used such reviews for years to reduce the use of 
D  addictive drugs. [ITALIC][RIGHT]<TB>— Don Sapatkin[/ITALIC]

D  Portraits of black faculty members defaced at Harvard Law
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Collin Binkley
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]ASSOCIATED PRESS
D  [/BYCREDIT][KERN-2]BOSTON — Portraits of several black professors 
D  were found vandalized at Harvard Law School on Thursday, a day 
D  after a campus rally for black students.
D  [/KERN-2][KERN-3]Black strips of tape were placed diagonally over 
D  at least five photo portraits, Harvard officials said. Students 
D  and professors noticed the tape as classes met Thursday morning at 
D  Wasserstein Hall, which houses two hallways lined with framed 
D  portraits of more than 180 professors.
D  [/KERN-3]All of the portraits that were targeted depict black 
D  professors, but some portraits of black professors appeared to be 
D  untouched. Harvard officials said they don’t know why some 
D  professors were singled out or who’s responsible. 
D  “Expressions of hatred are abhorrent, whether they be directed at 
D  race, sex, sexual preference, gender identity, religion or any 
D  other targets of bigotry,” the law school’s dean, Martha Minow, 
D  said in a statement. 
D  She added that the vandalism was being treated as a hate crime. 
D  Harvard police were investigating but declined to comment. 
D  [KERN-3]The discovery stirred the campus a day after students 
D  rallied in support of black students across the United States. 
D  Racially charged protests at the University of Missouri this month 
D  touched off a wave of demonstrations and frank discussions about 
D  race at many other campuses. 
D  [/KERN-3]Harvard students have called on the law school to open a 
D  diversity office, among other demands. <WC>S<WC1>ome  are pushing 
D  the law school to change its official seal, which is borrowed from 
D  the family crest of an 18th-century slaveholder whose estate 
D  helped found the school. 
D  A university spokeswoman said she didn’t know if there<WC> wa<WC1>
D  s a connection between the recent protests and the vandalism. 
D  Some students said they were disturbed by the vandalism, calling 
D  it an overt display of racism.
D  “I know what it looks like when you’re being told to get back into 
D  your place, and I think that is very much what this looks like,” 
D  said Rena Karefa-Johnson, a third-year law student and a leader of 
D  Students For Inclusion, <NO1>an activist group supporting<NO><WC>
D  which supports<WC1> minority students at the law school.
D  Leland Shelton, a third-year law student, said the vandalism is 
D  one more thing to make black students feel unwelcome. <WC>“<WC1>
D  This kind of proves that we’re not just making this stuff up,” 
D  said Shelton, who is president of the Harvard Black Law Students 
D  Association. 
D  <NO1>Amid pressure from students, the law school’s dean called an 
D  open meeting Thursday to discuss the vandalism and issues tied to 
D  race.
D  <NO>By Thursday afternoon, the tape had been removed from the<NO1> 
D  glass over the<NO> portraits<NO1>, and students were sticking 
D  notes of support around the photos<NO>.

D  Temple Mount and to Muslims a<WC>s<WC1> the Noble Sanctuary — 
D  something Israel vehemently denies.<NO>
D  Palestinians say the violence is rooted in frustration at decades 
D  of living under Israeli occupation. Israel accuses Palestinian 
D  leaders of inciting the unrest. 
D  The violence was initially confined to Jerusalem and gradually 
D  spread deeper into Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
D  In Thursday’s first attack, a knife-wielding man stabbed and 
D  killed two Israelis as several of them gathered for afternoon 
D  prayers on the second floor of an office building in Tel Aviv. 
D  Shimon Vaknin, a witness, told reporters he saw a bloodied man 
D  stumble into the room where he prayed with companions. 
D  “He was all slashed and bloody. We were in shock,” Vaknin said. 
D  “We didn’t know what happened and then someone near the door 
D  shouted: ‘There’s a terrorist.<WC>’<TH><WC1>”
D  He described a dramatic standoff, with worshipers standing against 
D  the closed shop door as the assailant tried to force his way 
D  in.<NO1> Israeli media showed footage of a blood-spattered floor 
D  littered with plastic gloves. <NO>
D  Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the attacker was apprehended by 
D  onlookers. She identified him as Raed Khalil bin Mahmoud, 36<WC>, 
D  a<WC1> Palestinian father of five from the West Bank village of 
D  Dura, near the city of Hebron. 
D  Hours later, a Palestinian motorist opened fire on a line of cars 
D  stuck in traffic in Gush Etzion, an area south of Jerusalem in the 
D  West Bank.
D  The Israeli military said he then intentionally rammed his vehicle 
D  into a group of pedestrians. The military said soldiers shot at 
D  the attacker, “identifying a hit,” although the attacker’s 
D  condition w<WC>as<WC1> not known. 
D  That attack killed three people, including an 18-year-old American 
D  and an Israeli. Among the dead was a Palestinian man, but police 
D  said it was not clear <WC>whether <WC1>he was hit by the 
D  attacker’s fire or that of Israeli forces.
D  <NO1>U.S. State Dept. spokesman Edgar Vasquez confirmed the 
D  American’s death but did not disclose his identity. “We extend our 
D  condolences to his family and friends. Out of respect for the 
D  privacy of the family, we have no further details to share,” he 
D  said. 
D  Since the violence broke out, Israel has sent troops to back up 
D  thousands of police patrolling cities, set up checkpoints in Arab 
D  neighborhoods of east Jerusalem, and outlawed an Islamic group 
D  accused of inciting to violence. But it has struggled to contain 
D  the seemingly spontaneous attacks. 
D  Thursday’s Tel Aviv attack, inside an expansive office building in 
D  the middle of the day, in particular stoked Israeli fears that a 
D  full-fledged Palestinian uprising could erupt. Attacks inside 
D  Israel have grown rare in recent weeks even as violence continued 
D  to roil the West Bank. 
D  Palestinian attacks have claimed the lives of 17 Israelis in total 
D  since the flare-up began. At least 84 Palestinians have been 
D  killed by Israeli fire, 52 of them said by Israel to be attackers, 
D  the remainder killed in clashes with Israeli troops. A Palestinian 
D  died from his wounds Thursday after clashing with Israeli troops 
D  last week. 
D  Previous deadly days have seen eight Palestinians killed, mainly 
D  in clashes with Israeli troops on the Gaza border. In another day 
D  of violence last month, three Israelis and three Palestinians, 
D  including two said by Israel to have been attackers, were killed. 
D  
D  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and security 
D  officials discussed ways to contain attackers emanating from 
D  Hebron, which has become the focal point for violence in recent 
D  weeks, as well as steps against Israelis who hire Palestinians 
D  illegally. Israel grants thousands of permits for Palestinians to 
D  work in Israel, while thousands of others enter illegally. 
D  The violence has Israelis on edge. Several politicians have urged 
D  licensed gun owners to carry their weapons and there have been 
D  several bloody accidents. 
D  In one case, an Israeli man stabbed a fellow Jew, thinking his 
D  victim was an Arab because of his dark skin, and a security guard 
D  shot an Eritrean migrant he thought was an attacker during a bus 
D  station shooting last month. 
D  Shortly after the Tel Aviv attack, Mayor Ron Huldai called for 
D  Israelis to remain calm. “This thing is part of the routine of our 
D  lives,” Huldai told Israeli Channel 2 TV. 
D  Also on Thursday, Israeli Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai and Palestinian 
D  Minister of Civil Affairs Hussen al-Sheikh signed an agreement 
D  granting Palestinian mobile carriers 3G high-speed data services 
D  in the West Bank. 
D  Under interim peace agreements, Israel controls cellular networks 
D  in the West Bank. Israeli cellular carriers transmit 3G, but 
D  Palestinian networks have been confined to the slower 2G networks. 
D  The agreement will not enable 4G service for Palestinians, nor 
D  will it cover the Gaza Strip. 
D  Meanwhile, Israeli police said a Jerusalem court sentenced a 
D  police officer to six weeks of community service for beating a 
D  Palestinian-American teenager during a violent protest in July 
D  2014. The officer was sentenced Wednesday. 
D  Fifteen-year-old Tariq Abu Khdeir, of Tampa, Florida, was beaten 
D  at an east Jerusalem protest following the murder of his cousin. 
D  Israeli extremists burned 16-year-old Mohammed alive in revenge 
D  for the killings of three Israeli teens in the West Bank. 
D  Abu Khdeir’s attorney Mohammad Mahmoud said Thursday the ruling 
D  delivered an “extremely light” punishment that “gives (police) a 
D  free hand.”

D  [/BYCREDIT]SAN DIEGO — More Mexicans are leaving than moving into 
D  the United States, reversing the flow of a half-century of mass 
D  migration, according to a study published Thursday.
D  The Pew Research Center found that slightly more than <WC>one<WC1> 
D  million Mexicans and their families, including American-born 
D  children, left the U<WC>nited <WC1>S<WC>tates<WC1> for Mexico from 
D  2009 to 2014. During the same five years, 870,000 Mexicans came to 
D  the U.S., resulting in a net flow to Mexico of 140,000.
D  [KERN-2]The desire to reunite families is the main reason more 
D  Mexicans are moving south than north, Pew found. The sluggish U.S. 
D  economic recovery and tougher border enforcement are other key 
D  factors.
D  [/KERN-2]The era of mass migration from Mexico is “at an end,” 
D  declared Mark Hugo Lopez, Pew’s director of Hispanic research.
D  [KERN-2]The finding follows a Pew study in 2012 that found net 
D  migration between the two countries was near zero, so this 
D  represents a turning point in one of the largest mass migrations 
D  in U.S. history. More than 16 million Mexicans moved to the United 
D  States from 1965 to 2015, more than from any other country.
D  [/KERN-2]“This is something that we’ve seen coming,” Lopez said. 
D  “It’s been almost 10 years that migration from Mexico has really 
D  slowed down.” 
D  The findings counter the narrative of an out-of-control border 
D  that has figured prominently in U.S. presidential campaigns, with 
D  Republican Donald Trump calling for Mexico <WC>to <WC1>pay for a 
D  fence to run the entire length of the 1,954-mile frontier. Pew 
D  said there were 11.7 million Mexicans living in the U.S. last 
D  year, down from a peak of 12.8 million in 2007. That includes 5.6 
D  million living in the U.S. illegally, down from 6.9 million in 
D  2007. 
D  [KERN-1]In another first, the Border Patrol arrested more 
D  non-Mexicans than Mexicans in the 2014 fiscal year, as more 
D  Central Americans came to the U.S., mostly through South Texas, 
D  and many  turned themselves in to authorities. 
D  [/KERN-1][KERN-3]The authors analyzed U.S. and Mexican census data 
D  and a 2014 survey by Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and 
D  Geography. The Mexican questionnaire asked about residential 
D  history, and found that 61 percent of those who reported living in 
D  the U.S. in 2009 but were back in Mexico last year had returned to 
D  join or start a family. An additional 14 percent had been 
D  deported, and 6 percent said they returned for jobs in Mexico. 
D  [/KERN-3]<NO1>Dowell Myers, a public policy professor at the 
D  University of Southern California, said it’s lack of jobs in the 
D  U.S. — not family ties — that is mostly motivating Mexicans to 
D  leave. Construction is a huge draw for young immigrants, but has 
D  yet to approach the levels of last decade’s housing boom, he said. 
D  
D  “It’s not like all of a sudden they decided they missed their 
D  mothers,” Myers said. “The fact is, our recovery from the Great 
D  Recession has been miserable. It’s been miserable for everyone.” 
D  Also, Mexico’s population is aging, meaning there’s less 
D  competition for young people looking for work. That’s a big change 
D  from the 1990s, when many people entering the workforce felt they 
D  had no choice but to migrate north of the border, Myers said. 
D  <NO>[KERN-3]While the U.S. economic recovery is sluggish, Mexico 
D  has been free in recent years from the economic tailspins that 
D  drove earlier generations north in the 1980s and 1990s. While many 
D  parts of Mexico suffer grinding poverty and violence, others have 
D  become thriving manufacturing centers under the North American 
D  Free Trade Agreement. 
D  [/KERN-3]<NO1>Automakers including Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. 
D  and General Motors Corp. have built plants across central and 
D  northern Mexico that employ thousands, spawning auto-parts plants 
D  and other ripple effects. Highways and rail lines that connect to 
D  the world’s largest economy north of the border have attracted 
D  more investors. 
D  “The main reason for my return is family,” José Arellano Correa, a 
D  41-year-old Mexico City taxi driver who came back from the U.S. in 
D  2005. “I could help them while I was there, but family comes 
D  before money.” 
D  Farmworkers recruited from Mexico to harvest U.S. crops had 
D  followed the seasons back and forth across the border until 1965, 
D  when the U.S. imposed numerical limits on Latin American 
D  immigrants for the first time, launching new waves of illegal 
D  immigration that flowed north for decades thereafter. 
D  A federal law passed in 1986, four years after Mexico’s economy 
D  convulsed, led to a more fortified border and legal status for 
D  millions of migrants. Policies toughened even more after 9/11, 
D  with the Border Patrol doubling in size and the U.S. erecting 
D  hundreds of miles of fences, and Arizona led a backlash in state 
D  capitols as Mexicans moved beyond traditional destinations like 
D  Los Angeles and Chicago, settling in towns throughout the South 
D  and Midwest. 
D  Many Mexicans in the U.S. have become frustrated and fearful as 
D  efforts to overhaul immigration laws stalled in Congress and 
D  President Barack Obama deported roughly 2 million people during 
D  the first five years of his administration. Obama’s 2014 order 
D  shielding many others from deportation remains blocked in court. 
D  Mexicans who remain in the U.S. also seem more detached from their 
D  homeland than before. Pew said their median age was 39 years in 
D  2013, compared to 29 in 1990. More than three in four had been in 
D  the U.S. for more than a decade, compared to only half in 1990. 
D  And only 35 percent of adults in Mexico say they have friends or 
D  relatives they regularly communicate with or visit in the U.S., 
D  down 7 percentage points from 2007, Pew found. 
D  Guadalupe Romo, 49, has lived in Fresno, California, for 26 years 
D  and has no plans to leave. 
D  “We have our life here,” she said at Fresno’s Mexican consulate. 
D  “There’s no point in going back to Mexico.”

D  <NO>[/WEBHEAD][BYLINE]By <WC1>Brady Dennis
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]WASHINGTON POST
D  [/BYCREDIT]After years of review, the Food and Drug Administration 
D  on Thursday approved the nation’s first genetically altered animal 
D  — a salmon engineered to grow twice as fast as its natural 
D  counterpart. 
D  AquAdvantage, produced by Massachusetts-based AquaBounty, is an 
D  Atlantic salmon that contains a growth hormone from a Chinook 
D  salmon and has been given a gene from the ocean pout, an eel-like 
D  fish. The result is a fish that is large enough for consumption in 
D  about a year and a half, rather than the typical three years. 
D  Food-safety activists, environmental groups<WC>,<WC1> and the 
D  salmon fishing industry, not to mention lawmakers from Alaska, 
D  have long opposed the approval of the fish — which they derisively 
D  refer to as “Frankenfish” — and have argued that its existence 
D  could open the door to a broad range of potentially unsafe 
D  genetically modified animal foods. Knowing an FDA approval was 
D  likely, critics have in recent years won commitments from some of 
D  the nation’s most recognizable chains <WC>—<WC1> including Whole 
D  Foods, Trader Joe’s<WC>,<WC1> and Target <WC>—<WC1> to not sell 
D  the fish. 
D  [KERN-1]The FDA said Thursday that its decision was “based on 
D  sound science and a comprehensive review,” and that regulators are 
D  confident that the genetically altered fish is as safe to eat as a 
D  normal Atlantic salmon, with no discernible difference in its 
D  nutritional value. Officials noted that the agency held meetings, 
D  combed through thousands of public comments<WC>,<WC1> and 
D  conducted scientific and environmental assessments about the 
D  AquaBounty fish before finally approving it. 
D  [/KERN-1][KERN-2]“All of that took time,” said Laura Epstein, a 
D  senior policy analyst in the FDA’s center for veterinary medicine. 
D  “As with many products that are the first of their kind, we’re 
D  very careful to be sure we’re getting everything right.” 
D  [/KERN-2]Salmon fishermen and environmental activists have raised 
D  concerns about the havoc that could occur if any of AquaBounty’s 
D  engineered salmon made it into ocean waters and mated with wild 
D  Atlantic salmon — a scenario they say could have unpredictable<WC> 
D  effects <WC1>and lead to the decimation of wild populations. 
D  AquaBounty has said its fish are all female and sterile, making it 
D  impossible for them to breed with other salmon, even if they 
D  somehow were to escape their <WC>landlocked<WC1> production 
D  facilities. The company argues its fish actually could reduce 
D  pressure on wild fish stocks and prevent the overfishing of 
D  Atlantic salmon. 
D  The FDA said Thursday <WC>that <WC1>it w<WC>ould<WC1> require the 
D  AquaBounty salmon to be raised only in land-based, contained tanks 
D  in two specific facilities in Canada and Panama, and that it will 
D  conduct regular inspections. The approval also doesn’t allow the 
D  salmon to be bred or raised in the United States for now, though 
D  FDA officials said the company could apply to have other 
D  production sites approved in the future. 
D  <NO1>Critics have argued that an FDA approval of AquaBounty’s 
D  salmon could open the floodgates for other genetically engineered 
D  animals, each with its own health and environmental concerns.<WC>
D  <WC1>“It was a flawed and irresponsible approval<WC>.<WC1> ... It 
D  sets a very dangerous precedent, given our federal government 
D  agencies are ill-equipped to handle genetically engineered 
D  animals,” said Dana Perls, food and technology campaigner at 
D  Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental 
D  organizations that has vehemently fought AquaBounty’s efforts. “I 
D  think it is a grave mistake we will come to regret.” 
D  Perls said her group and others would continue to try to undermine 
D  the market for the fish. “It’s clear: People don’t want to eat 
D  it,” she said. “We’re going to continue to work with grocery 
D  stores and retailers to continue to listen to consumers who don’t 
D  want to eat this under-studied, unlabeled GMO fish.” 
D  Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, has long opposed the AquaBounty fish, 
D  saying that its existence would threaten a mainstay industry of 
D  his state. He repeatedly has pushed for delays in the FDA approval 
D  process, telling The Washington Post in a 2012 interview that he 
D  hoped such hurdles eventually would “break that company.” 
D  “This harebrained decision goes to show that our federal agencies 
D  are incapable of using common sense,” Young said in a statement 
D  Thursday. “By embarking on this science experiment, the FDA 
D  ignores fundamental risk questions related to our wild fish 
D  species and food safety.” 
D  Others welcomed the FDA approval Thursday, none more than the 
D  company that has spent two decades developing genetically 
D  engineered salmon. “We’re thrilled,” AquaBounty chief executive 
D  Ron Stotish said when reached on his cell phone early Thursday. 
D  “We think this is good for science, we think it’s good for 
D  aquaculture, we think it’s good for consumers.” 
D  Stotish took over at the helm in 2008 at AquaBounty, which he said 
D  now employees 21 people, and is acutely aware of the fierce 
D  opposition among many activists to the firm’s genetically 
D  engineered salmon. But he said he hopes to win over critics in 
D  time.

D  Ex-Subway pitchman Fogle gets more than 15 years in prison
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Rick Callahan
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]ASSOCIATED PRESS
D  [/BYCREDIT]INDIANAPOLIS — Jared Fogle emerged from obscurity to 
D  become the unlikely face of one of the nation’s biggest restaurant 
D  chains, earning a small fortune by touting the benefits of a 
D  healthy lifestyle that included Subway sandwiches. 
D  But his wholesome public image was only that, and on Thursday he 
D  was sentenced to more than 15 years in prison for trading in child 
D  pornography and having sex with underage prostitutes. 
D  Fogle, 38, sought leniency, apologizing to his victims and telling 
D  the court in a tearful statement that he was raised with good 
D  values by a good family, but succumbed to self-centered “deception 
D  and lies.” He said he wished he had realized long ago that he had 
D  a problem. 
D  “I had become dependent on alcohol, pornography<WC>,<WC1> and 
D  prostitutes,” he told the judge. “<WC>…<WC1> I want to redeem my 
D  life. I want to become a good, decent person. I want to rebuild my 
D  life.” 
D  Judge Tanya Walton Pratt wasn’t swayed, though, and gave him a 
D  harsher sentence than the 12<MD+,%21,%70,%70><WC>1<MD><CS4>/</CS>
D  <MD-,%0,%70,%70>2<MD><WC1> years that prosecutors had sought. She 
D  also ordered him to submit to a lifetime of post-prison 
D  supervision and fined him $175,000. 
D  “What a gift, to have such a professional windfall fall in your 
D  lap,” Pratt said, referring to the lucrative deal Subway gave 
D  Fogle after he lost more than 200 pounds in college, partly by 
D  eating its sandwiches. But she said Fogle blew the chance he’d 
D  been given by living a double life and pointed out that the crimes 
D  he committed weren’t victimless. 
D  “The level of perversion and lawlessness exhibited by Mr. Fogle is 
D  extreme,” said Pratt. She recommended Fogle receive sex<WC>-<WC1>
D  offender treatment in prison and said she<WC> would <WC1>recommend 
D  he serve his time at a federal lockup in Littleton, Colo<WC>.<WC1>
D  , that specializes in such treatment. 
D  As he was being led from the courtroom in handcuffs, the father of 
D  two blew kisses to crying relatives. 
D  Fogle pleaded guilty to one count each of traveling to engage in 
D  illicit sexual conduct with a minor and distribution and receipt 
D  of child pornography, per a deal he struck with prosecutors in 
D  August<NO1>, a month after authorities raided his suburban 
D  Indianapolis home<NO>. <NO1>Fogle attorney Ron Elberger did not 
D  respond to a question about whether Fogle will appeal his 
D  sentence. 
D  Fogle agreed to pay a total of $1.4 million to his 14 victims.<WC>
D  
D  [KERN-2]<WC1>In arguing for a five-year prison term, Fogle 
D  attorney Jeremy Margolis told Pratt that Fogle is ready for prison 
D  and has “lost his wife, he’s lost the children he loved and he’s 
D  not going to see them for years and years and years.” 
D  [/KERN-2]“No one wants to be Jared Fogle. He is one of the most 
D  despised individuals in America,” Margolis told the judge.

D  <MC>Uber defies Montevideo’s order and begins service
D  </MC>[/RDBITS16_2]<WC1>A week after Montevideo taxi drivers 
D  blocked streets and gate<WC>-<WC1>crashed an Uber driver training 
D  course, the city administration said Uber Technologies Inc. would 
D  require government approval to operate. The company started its 
D  service anyway. 
D  Montevideo will enforce its transportation rules, which include 
D  sanctions such as confiscating the license plates of vehicles 
D  caught providing unauthorized services, the capital’s legal 
D  affairs director, Ernesto Beltrame, told reporters. 
D  <WC>“<WC1>We live under the rule of law where everyone should 
D  respect the rules,” Beltrame said. “We can’t allow the legal 
D  system to be trampled on.” 
D  Uber started operations at 1 p.m. Thursday, even after the local 
D  government sent the company a warning letter, said an official at 
D  the media relations company representing Uber. Taxis and city bus 
D  companies oppose Uber, which they say offers the same services, 
D  but without costly regulations. The stakes are especially high for 
D  taxi owners who pay as much as $100,000 for a license. [SIGNATURE]

D  Allowing Bashar Assad to continue leading Syria is ’unimaginable,’ 
D  Obama says
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Michael A. Memoli
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]TRIBUNE WASHINGTON BUREAU
D  [/BYCREDIT]MANILA, Philippines — President Obama insisted Thursday 
D  that any political solution to end the bloody Syrian civil war 
D  must include Bashar al-Assad’s stepping down from power, rebutting 
D  Russian suggestions that the U.S. could bend on a key demand in 
D  the interest of aligning efforts to take on Islamic State.
D  Even if he were willing to consider such a scenario, Obama said, 
D  the Syrian people would never accept it. 
D  [KERN-1]“It is unimaginable that you can stop the civil war here 
D  when the overwhelming majority of people in Syria consider him to 
D  be a brutal, murderous dictator,” Obama said. “He cannot regain 
D  legitimacy.”<NO1>Bloomberg reported Thursday that Russian 
D  officials were increasingly confident the U.S. and France were 
D  ready to agree on coordinating efforts to fight Islamic State, 
D  perhaps including Assad’s forces. 
D  <NO> Obama has said that Assad’s status remained a sticking point 
D  to such coordination with Russia, and that the U.S. would continue 
D  to evaluate whether Russia was serious about focusing its military 
D  strikes against Islamic State instead of  forces battling Assad. 
D  [/KERN-1][KERN-1]As talks continue in Vienna aimed at defining the 
D  political solution, Obama said Assad’s backers in Russia and Iran 
D  need to make a final choice, whether to continue to “prop up 
D  Assad,” or to “save the Syrian state and work with the 
D  international community … to find a government that can be truly 
D  legitimate.” He said it could take months for Russia, Iran, and 
D  the Syrian regime to recognize that a political solution including 
D  Iran was untenable. 
D  [/KERN-1][KERN-3]The president’s comments came as he sat down for 
D  the first time with Canada’s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, 
D  on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in Manila.
D  [/KERN-3]The premier reiterated that he would fulfill his campaign 
D  pledge to end Canada’s limited air campaign against Islamic State, 
D  but said his country would do “more than its part to defend 
D  against” the militant group, including an increased deployment of 
D  forces to train local fighters.
D  Bloomberg reported Thursday that Russian officials were 
D  increasingly confident the U.S. and France were ready to agree on 
D  coordinating efforts to fight Islamic State, perhaps including 
D  Assad’s forces.
D  <NO1><WC1>Obama Cites Split Over Assad to Temper Kremlin Talk of 
D  Alliance 
D  [BYCREDIT]BLOOMBERG
D  [/BYCREDIT]By Angela Greiling Keane, Toluse Olorunnipa and Nicole 
D  Gaouette 
D  (Bloomberg) — President Barack <NO><WC>But <WC1>Obama has moved to 
D  dent Russia’s optimism<NO1> that a deal is near for the U.S. to 
D  coordinate with Russia in fighting Islamic State<NO>, underscoring 
D  the enduring disagreement over the fate of <NO1>Syrian President 
D  Bashar al-<NO>Assad.
D  [KERN-3]“At some point the Russians and the Iranians are going to 
D  have to make a fundamental decision,” Obama told reporters <NO1>in 
D  Manila <WC>on <WC1>Thursday<NO>at the <NO1>Asia-Pacific Economic 
D  Cooperation<NO>summit. “Do they actually believe that they can 
D  prop up Assad and win on the ground militarily inside of Syria 
D  against all of the opposition? Or do they think it is actually 
D  better to save the Syrian state?” 
D  [/KERN-3]Obama’s comments were an effort to temper expectations, 
D  encouraged by the Kremlin, that an alliance may be announced as 
D  early as next week to attack the terrorist group.<WC>
D  <NO1><WC1>French President Francois Hollande plans to visit 
D  Washington and Moscow next week to seek a unified effort, seizing 
D  on international outrage over the bombing of a Russian passenger 
D  jet over Egypt and last week’s <WC>deadly <WC1>attacks in Paris 
D  that killed at least 129 people. 
D  In addition to managing the expectations of Europeans and moderate 
D  Syrian opposition groups, Obama has to weigh the risk that working 
D  with Putin would deeply alienate Sunni allies such as Saudi 
D  Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. They see Putin 
D  fighting to save Assad, whose Alawite sect is a Shiite offshoot 
D  and who they believe turned on his country’s Sunni citizens. 
D  “Russia and the Iranians are absolutely not our allies,” Ryan 
D  Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, told a U.S. House 
D  committee on Wednesday. “Any perception of U.S. association with 
D  Russia or Iran in the fight against Islamic State is going to turn 
D  the Sunni world, inside Syria and outside of it, against us.” 
D  The approach to a combined effort against Islamic State, as 
D  described by two Russian officials, would effectively include 
D  Assad’s forces. Obama and allies — including Hollande — have said 
D  international efforts now under way to achieve a lasting 
D  resolution to Syria’s civil war must lead to Assad stepping down 
D  eventually. 
D  Obama has said the only way the U.S. would coordinate with Putin 
D  against Islamic State is if it’s clear Russia has stopped 
D  targeting anti-Assad forces supported by the U.S. and its allies 
D  in its campaign of airstrikes. 
D  The Russians “will have to make a fundamental shift, I believe, in 
D  policy” away from keeping Assad in power, Obama said in Manila. 
D  “What we are doing with our coalition members is recognizing that 
D  it may take some months for the Russians, the Iranians and frankly 
D  some of the members of the Syrian government and dueling elites in 
D  the regime to recognize the truth that I just articulated,” he 
D  said. 
D  Obama had said Wednesday he thought the bombing last month of the 
D  Russian passenger jet over the Sinai Peninsula — an attack Islamic 
D  State has taken responsibility for — may lead Russia to change 
D  course in Syria. 
D  Beyond reassuring Sunni allies and Assad’s moderate opposition, 
D  Obama’s message of caution on cooperation with Russia sent a 
D  signal to European allies that it won’t sell out Ukraine to win 
D  Putin’s cooperation on Syria, said Matthew Rojansky, director of 
D  the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington policy 
D  group. 
D  “That is, of course, unacceptable to them,” Rojansky said, “and 
D  the pressure is very strong not to go that route.” The U.S. and 
D  European Union maintain economic sanctions against Russia over its 
D  intervention in Ukraine. 
D  Rojansky also cited Obama’s usually cautious style. The president 
D  “doesn’t like to invest his political capital in things that don’t 
D  work,” he said. 
D  Some cooperation may be inevitable, given Russia’s interests in 
D  Syria, said John McLaughlin, the former deputy director of the 
D  Central Intelligence Agency. The challenge for Obama is figuring 
D  out how. 
D  The U.S. shouldn’t be “making an alliance with him or anything 
D  like that,” McLaughlin told lawmakers at the House hearing, and 
D  any cooperation should be limited in time and scope. “If we can 
D  find a way to gain Russian cooperation without sacrificing too 
D  much of our own interests, I don’t see that as counterproductive,” 
D  McLaughlin said. 
D  The president commented on Syria after a meeting with Canadian 
D  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the APEC summit. Putin didn’t 
D  attend, sending Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Obama 
D  and Putin spoke earlier this week at the Group of 20 summit in 
D  Turkey. 
D  Obama said it wouldn’t be enough to have political processes that 
D  leave open a way for Assad to stay in power. “It is unimaginable 
D  that you can stop the civil war there when the overwhelming 
D  majority of people in Syria consider him to be a brutal, murderous 
D  dictator,” he said. “He cannot regain legitimacy.” 
D  Hollande will visit the White House on Nov. 24 for talks with 
D  Obama before meeting Putin two days later in Moscow. Obama and 
D  Hollande spoke by phone on Thursday, according to a White House 
D  statement that said “both leaders reiterated their unwavering 
D  commitment to degrade and destroy” Islamic State. 
D  France has been part of a U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes 
D  against Islamic State targets for more than a year. The day before 
D  the killings in Paris, Obama said in an interview with ABC’s “This 
D  Week” that Islamic State had been “contained” geographically since 
D  the campaign began. 
D  Speaking at a briefing in Manila, Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy 
D  national security adviser, said the U.S. and France had the same 
D  interests with respect to Russia — to see it attack Islamic State, 
D  not moderate groups opposed to Assad. 
D  “Thus far what we have done is simply deconflict some of our 
D  military operations” rather than coordinate military strikes with 
D  the Russians, Rhodes said. 
D  “The most important thing that Russia can do is to use its unique 
D  relationship with the Assad regime” in order to ensure he leaves 
D  power, he said.<NO>[SHIRTTAIL]<WC>This article contains

D  FBI head: No credible threat to US after Paris attacks
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Eric Tucker<WC>
D  <WC1>and Michael Biesecker
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]ASSOCIATED PRESS
D  [/BYCREDIT]WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey said Thursday 
D  there is no credible threat to the United States following the 
D  Paris terror attacks, and that investigators have found no links 
D  between the attackers and the U<WC>nited <WC1>S<WC>tates<WC1>. 
D  [KERN-1]Appearing before reporters alongside Attorney General 
D  Loretta Lynch, Comey said he was aware that the Islamic State and 
D  its supporters regularly issue propaganda in videos and magazines 
D  boasting about their plans and capabilities. But, he said, “that 
D  is not credible intelligence.” 
D  [/KERN-1][KERN-1]The FBI is closely tracking dozens of people who 
D  agents are concerned could be particularly prone to violence, 
D  Comey said. In response to the Paris terror attacks, agents are 
D  giving extra scrutiny to individuals who “might be tempted to be a 
D  copycat,” but have not seen any evidence of Islamic State 
D  supporters dispatched to the U.S. for the purpose of committing 
D  attacks. 
D  [/KERN-1]“The risk with a troubled soul who is consuming the 
D  propaganda is that they might try and copy that which they saw in 
D  Europe,” Comey said. 
D  The attacks in Paris have stoked global fears about the flow of 
D  foreign fighters from Western nations in and out of Syria. U.S. 
D  officials are aware of roughly 250 people who have traveled or 
D  attempted to travel there from the United States, Comey said, 
D  although the number has slowed considerably in recent months for 
D  reasons that aren’t clear. 
D  “My hope is that the message has gotten out that it’s hell on 
D  earth in the so-called caliphate,” Comey said. 
D  <NO1>But it could also be that IS has been urging its followers 
D  not to travel and to instead attack targets where they are, he 
D  said. 
D  He described IS as a “death cult,” not unlike the hundreds who 
D  drank poison at Jonestown, the commune in Guyana that was the 
D  scene of mass suicide in 1978. But, he conceded, they are very 
D  effective at using social media to send their propaganda of hatred 
D  to disaffected people all over the world, especially the young. 
D  “They are broadcasting a message that is buzzing 24 hours a day in 
D  someone’s pocket,” Comey said. “That is a message of ‘ultimate 
D  meaning.’ That you can participate in the final battle between 
D  good and evil, you can find a source of meaning in your life that 
D  is transcendent. And that’s a message that resonates with people 
D  that are unmoored. We are a country of over 300 million people. We 
D  have some unmoored folks.” 
D  The Paris attacks have brought renewed attention to the ongoing 
D  debate between the Obama administration and technology companies 
D  over encrypted communication platforms. Comey and Lynch would not 
D  discuss whether encryption was used, but they said they were 
D  continuing to have discussions with the companies over lawfully 
D  obtaining access to encrypted communication. 
D  The Obama administration ultimately decided against seeking 
D  legislation to address an issue that Comey said is “crashing into 
D  public safety.” But the FBI director said law enforcement 
D  officials were in the process of collecting examples of cases in 
D  which encryption has affected their work, and that the dialogue 
D  with the companies was in a “healthier place.”

D  [/BYCREDIT]Feminist icon Gloria Steinem took the stage 
D  Thursday<NO1>11/19<NO> at the 12th annual Pennsylvania Conference 
D  for Women in Center City, and about 8,000 women seemed to hang on 
D  her every word — and her counsel to “become whole by venturing 
D  outside the home.”
D  [KERN+1]At the keynote luncheon, Steinem was joined by and traded 
D  questions with actress/businesswoman Jessica Alba, who talked 
D  about how she founded the Honest Company, a personal-care products 
D  enterprise.
D  Alba recalled how, at age 5, she began calling herself a feminist. 
D  
D  [/KERN+1]“A lot of people said no to me” on the journey to found 
D  her company, Alba said, “but I needed that. In business, it made 
D  me determined to make it happen.”
D  Alba brought the Hollywood bling, but it was Steinem whom 
D  conference participants came to hear. 
D  Pay inequity was her hot topic. Steinem noted that women are 
D  underpaid for their work outside the home, and that they should be 
D  paid for the caregiving work they do at home, as well, perhaps 
D  through a mandated tax credit. 
D  “It’s going to take a major rebellion,” Steinem said, laughing. 
D  Her comment drew hoots and deafening applause. 
D  “But at least that way, our work acquires economic value,” she 
D  said.
D  [KERN+2]Gov. Wolf opened the conference at the Convention Center, 
D  saying, as the father of two daughters, that “discrimination is 
D  stupid” and vowing to pursue pay equity in Pennsylvania. [/KERN+2]
D  
D  “Equal pay would be a way better economic stimulus than bailout of 
D  the banks,” Steinem said. “We have to be fierce about it.”
D  She highlighted women in STEM careers (science, technology, 
D  engineering, and math) such as Sandy Lerner, inventor of the 
D  router and cofounder of Cisco Systems.
D  “Women invented the router that all of Cisco is based on,” Steinem 
D  told the crowd.
D  Alba said social change is happening through businesses such as 
D  hers, which promotes chemical-free beauty, personal and baby-care 
D  products. 
D  “People are voting with their pocketbooks,” she said.
D  Steinem concluded her remarks by saying: “Behave as if everything 
D  you do matters, because it might.” Afterward, she signed copies of 
D  her recently released book, [ITALIC]My Life on the Road[/ITALIC].
D  At the luncheon and in the conference’s main exhibit space, 
D  entrepreneurs and attendees were in high spirits. 
D  “I came to get motivated, to network. I brought my 28-year-old 
D  daughter because she’ll learn how to advocate the way I do in the 
D  community,” said Jeannette Davis, who runs the DIVAS Ministry out 
D  of Northeast Philadelphia. Her nonprofit creates baskets of 
D  toiletries for women in safe houses <NO1>from <NO>for victims of 
D  abuse. 
D  [KERN+3]Valerie Crabbe, founder of Being Beautiful Foundation, 
D  helps place foster children out of group homes and into private 
D  family residences.[/KERN+3][KERN+2] [/KERN+2]
D  “I brought some of my foster girls here so they can see what kind 
D  of women they can become,” Crabbe said.
D  Chaya Duraiswami, a GlaxoSmithKline employee from Collegeville, 
D  said she came “specifically to hear Gloria!” 
D  Three female founders of PinkWise attended the Philadelphia 
D  conference from North Carolina. 
D  “There’s nothing like this down by us,” said Patricia Potts, 
D  cofounder of the online community for financial information. 
D  “Women trust other women,” Potts said.
D  Vanessa Chan was prepping to pitch her product to QVC. A former 
D  McKinsey consultant, Chan founded a start-up last year for her 
D  product: a necklace that converts into earphones, called LoopIt.
D  Her Kickstarter campaign for LoopIt will be launched in 2016.
D  “I got the courage to take the plunge by going to women’s 
D  entrepreneur events” hosted by groups such as Ellevate, a national 
D  women’s networking organization with a Philadelphia chapter.
D  [KERN+3]Kim Ramirez, an alumna of PricewaterhouseCoopers who with 
D  her brother founded FactSUMO, an education-technology start-up 
D  already in use in the Trenton School District, agreed that the 
D  conference illustrated “the power of the network.”
D  [/KERN+3]“There are just so many women here,” Ramirez said.
D  <NO1>“I also came to hear Steinem,” she said.

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]<WC>ASSOCIATED PRESS<WC1>
D  [/BYCREDIT]The nation’s largest health insurer is questioning its 
D  future in public insurance exchanges, the latest signal of major 
D  concerns about the online marketplaces that have<WC> <WC1>helped 
D  the Affordable Care Act extend coverage to millions of people. 
D  UnitedHealth Group said Thursday that it w<WC>ould<WC1> scale back 
D  marketing for plans it sells on the exchanges and decide <WC>in 
D  2016 <NO1><WC1>next year<NO>whether it w<WC>ould<WC1> even stay in 
D  that business in<WC> <WC1>2017. 
D  The announcement come<WC>s<WC1> a few weeks after several smaller, 
D  nonprofit insurance cooperatives said they would stop selling 
D  coverage on the state-based exchanges. 
D  [KERN-2]Insurers are struggling to attract enough healthy 
D  customers into their still-new exchange coverage to balance sicker 
D  patients who signed up for coverage quicker because<WC> <WC1>they 
D  use a lot of health care. Until that happens, the exchanges won’t 
D  be a<WC> <WC1>viable, long-term market for these companies, 
D  Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj said. 
D  [/KERN-2]“The market still needs to mature,<WC>”<WC1> he said. 
D  “That’s the lesson here.” 
D  [KERN-2]<WC>T<WC1>he exchanges are<WC> <WC1>n<WC>o<WC1>t on the 
D  verge of collapse. Enrollment for 2016 coverage started Nov. 1, 
D  and more than <WC>one<WC1> million people signed up or renewed 
D  coverage<WC> <WC1>in the first two weeks, according to the Obama 
D  administration. 
D  [/KERN-2]The average number of insurers participating in the 
D  exchanges has climbed to 10 per state, up from <WC>eight in 
D  2014<WC1>, according to the Department of<WC> <WC1>Health and 
D  Human Services. 
D  [KERN+2]UnitedHealth rivals Aetna and Anthem said last month that 
D  they still s<WC>aw<WC1> potential in the business. Aetna<WC> <WC1>
D  CEO Mark Bertolini told analysts it was “way too early to call it 
D  quits.” [/KERN+2]
D  But UnitedHealth also endorsed its exchange business in October, 
D  when it said it would expand into 11 more exchanges next year 
D  after growing from four to 24 in 2015.
D  Chief <WC>f<WC1>inancial <WC>o<WC1>fficer David Wichmann told 
D  analysts then that the company expected<WC> <WC1>its exchange 
D  business to be “strikingly better” in 2016 and that the exchanges 
D  w<WC>ould<WC1> mature into a strong growth market. 
D  Since then, the insurer says financial hits from that business 
D  have <WC>be<WC1>come <NO1>into<NO>clearer<NO1> focus<NO>. The 
D  insurer has been hurt in particular by customers who signed up 
D  for<WC> <WC1>coverage outside the <NO1>open<NO>enrollment window 
D  and<WC>, because they may have gotten sick and needed <NO1>an <NO>
D  expensive care, <NO1>procedure,<NO><WC1>use more health care <NO1>
D  in general <NO>than<WC> <WC1>those who bought coverage <WC>in <NO1>
D  <WC1>during<NO>open enrollment. 
D  UnitedHealth expects to book an operating loss of slightly more 
D  than $700 million this year, largely from its exchange business. 
D  That includes advanced recognition of<WC> <WC1>$275 million in 
D  losses it anticipates from next year, when it also expects to 
D  lose<WC> <WC1>an additional $200 million to $225 million that it 
D  cannot record in advanced recognition. 
D  CEO Stephen Hemsley told investors Thursday that the company d<WC>
D  id <WC1>n<WC>o<WC1>t intend to take <WC>more <NO1><WC1>further<NO>
D  losses in 2017. 
D  “We cannot sustain these losses,” he said. “We can’t really 
D  subsidize a marketplace that doesn’t appear at the moment to be 
D  sustaining itself.” 
D  UnitedHealth covers a<WC>bout<WC1> 500,000 people through the 
D  public exchanges. That’s a small slice of the insurer’s total 
D  enrollment, which exceeds 46 million, and Hemsley<WC> <WC1>
D  emphasized <NO1>Thursday <NO>that the company’s overall business 
D  remain<WC>ed<WC1> strong. <WC>
D  Still, its exchange losses have been deep enough to force the 
D  company to cut a forecast it had already raised twice this year. 
D  UnitedHealth now expects 2015 earnings of about $6 a share, down 
D  from its previous forecast for $6.25 to $6.35 a share.<WC1>
D  [KERN-2]Insurers may start attracting more healthy customers to 
D  their exchange business in the coming years because a penalty that 
D  the overhaul imposes on those who remain<WC> <WC1>uninsured will 
D  grow, Morningstar<WC>’s <WC1>Lekraj said<WC>.<WC1>
D  [/KERN-2]The performance of insurers also is expected to improve 
D  as they learn more about the customers they serve in this new 
D  business and how to <NO1>set premiums or the <NO>price <NO1>of<NO>
D  coverage. 
D  Still, UnitedHealth’s unexpected announcement <NO1>Thursday<NO>is 
D  sure to stoke concerns about the long-term sustainability of the 
D  exchanges.

D  [WEBHEAD]Drexel partners with investors to launch $10 million fund 
D  to create firms from university projects[/WEBHEAD] 
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Jonathan Takiff[/BYLINE]
D  [BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]Drexel University already ranks among the top 50 
D  universities worldwide when it comes to patent awards developed by 
D  faculty members, said Keith Orris, university senior vice 
D  president of corporate relations and economic development. 
D  And with Thursday’s announcement of Drexel’s new funding 
D  partnership with Ben Franklin Technology Partners and a mentoring 
D  relationship with Wayne-based Safeguard Scientifics, university 
D  inventors and entrepreneurs will have 10 million new reasons to 
D  keep the research fires burning, the brainstorms exploding. 
D  Drexel and Ben Franklin are teaming up to create a<NO1>n early 
D  stage<NO> seed fund to support the creation of spin-off companies 
D  from university projects. For every investment dollar up to $5 
D  million that Drexel raises, <NO1>philanthropically<NO>Ben Franklin 
D  will match the money, Orris said. This seed money will be put 
D  toward  <NO1>so-called spin-up<NO>projects that have “already been 
D  vetted with proof of concept programs” previously funded by Drexel 
D  last year to the tune of $2 million, Orris said. 
D  In addition, venture capitalists of Safeguard Scientifics will be 
D  a “valued mentor” to the university innovators, said Shintaro 
D  Kaido, director of start-up services for Drexel Ventures, a 
D  university division. Although they are not moving into the 
D  university’s Innovation Center@3401 collaborative work space at 
D  34th and Market Streets, personnel from Ben Franklin and Safeguard 
D  will be regular visitors and counselors. 
D  As is common practice at universities, the intellectual property 
D  created by Drexel professors is owned by Drexel. 
D  Patent developers enjoy “a very attractive licensing policy, where 
D  they share in the patent royalties and licensing of their 
D  creations,” Orris said. Now the new fund gives them added 
D  incentive to create — and remain with Drexel — “as it encourages 
D  them to start up their own companies” without leaving University 
D  City, then grow those seeds into blooming ventures that can earn 
D  major backing and/or become targets for acquisition, he said.
D  After 10 years of “concerted investment” — much of it from the 
D  human health-focused Coulter Foundation — Drexel has “a pipeline 
D  of technologies” coming out of Drexel’s technology transfer and 
D  commercialization office, Kaido said. Among the most promising is 
D  an intelligent breast cancer detector <NO1>(using a “piezoelectric 
D  finger” sensor) <NO>developed by School of Biomedical Engineering, 
D  Science and Health Systems associate professor Wan Y. Shih and her 
D  husband Wei-Heng Shih, a professor in the Materials Science and 
D  Engineering Department. The team also is utilizing intelligent 
D  sensors to instantly assess the thoroughness of a tumor removal 
D  and to test for common bacterial infections <NO1>like Clostridium 
D  difficile (c.diff), which causes 14,000 deaths in the U.S. a 
D  year<NO>.
D  While the seed funding of up to “a couple hundred thousand 
D  dollars” per candidate first will be focused on helping 
D  faculty-steered ventures across all university disciplines, the 
D  candidate pool eventually will be expanded to include start-ups 
D  founded by Drexel alumni and students. 
D  For instance, Orris noted<NO1> proudly the student-developed 
D  Scholly scholarship search tool “which came out of our Close 
D  School of Entrepreneurship” and to<NO> Orange Maker, which moved a 
D  month ago to the Innovation Center and is working on a 
D  next-generation, higher-resolution 3D printing technology. Company 
D  cofounder Doug Farber is a recent Drexel alum.
D  The Innovation Center also houses the ExCiTe<NO1>cq <NO>Center for 
D  hands-on student project development, the world headquarters of 
D  DreamIt Ventures, and application-tools maker point.io<NO1>cq<NO>, 
D  “which moved in from the suburbs a year ago, has quickly expanded 
D  to about 35 employees, and is actively engaged in the Drexel 
D  ecosystem,” Orris said.

D  [/BYCREDIT]Business graduates will be most in demand among 
D  employers recruiting those with bachelor’s degrees from the Class 
D  of 2016, the National Association of Colleges and Employers<NO1>
D  cq<NO> reported Thursday.<NO1>11/19<NO>
D  [KERN-3]“We’re still hearing employers talk about the need for 
D  graduates to replace \[baby boomers\] who are retiring,” said 
D  Andrea<NO1>cq<NO> Koncz,<NO1>cq<NO> research director at the 
D  Bethlehem-based association.
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-3]<CS%-2>That same concern was voiced by 60 area 
D  employers and others who gathered at Cabrini College on 
D  Tuesday<NO1>11/17<NO> for a Technology Jobs Summit<NO1>cq<NO> 
D  sponsored by the Main Line Chamber of Commerce.<NO1>cq<NO>
D  </CS>“We know the demographics are a big deal with baby boomers 
D  retiring,” said Bernard Dagenais,<NO1>cq<NO> president and chief 
D  executive officer of the Main Line chamber.
D  [/KERN-3]While Tuesday’s meeting was focused on technology — and a 
D  bid to attract graduates with degrees in information technology, 
D  computer programming, computer science, and information-systems 
D  security — Main Line employers are looking more broadly at 
D  building a talent pipeline.
D  The Main Line chamber, one of five nationwide, received a $75,000 
D  grant to expand its Talent and Education Network<NO1>cq<NO> (TEN) 
D  intern program. 
D  [KERN-3]The grant, Dagenais said, will provide funding for 
D  increased staffing to connect with career offices at 22 area 
D  colleges, to screen interns based on employer requisitions, to 
D  advise companies that want to build internship programs, and to 
D  build professional development and networking opportunities for 
D  interns scattered among Main Line firms.[/KERN-3] “As time goes 
D  on, we’ll have an alumni network,” Dagenais said. That network 
D  will help companies fill future openings.
D  [KERN-2]In the summer,<NO1>2016<NO> Dagenais said, the TEN 
D  program will serve 60 interns, with the interview process already 
D  underway.
D  [/KERN-2]Nationally, internships are key. According to the 
D  National Association of Colleges and Employers, two-thirds of all 
D  2015 graduates had internships or co-op placements, based on a 
D  survey of 9,184 bachelor’s-degree students.
D  Employers are continuing to expand college hiring, NACE said. They 
D  plan to hire 11 percent more college graduates nationally than 
D  they did in 2015, based on an August survey of NACE members.
D  [KERN-3]<CS%-4>While most employers are expanding college hiring, 
D  “those that are decreasing hiring are doing it because of falling 
D  oil prices,” Koncz said.
D  </CS>[/KERN-3]Pay also has declined in that field, she said.
D  [KERN-3]<CS%-2>In 2016, petroleum-engineer graduates can expect to 
D  start at $84,000 a year, Koncz said. In 2015, they could plan on 
D  more than $95,000.
D  [/KERN-3]</CS>[KERN-3]<CS%-2>Accounting and finance typically 
D  command the top spots among degrees in demand, Koncz said. For 
D  2016, the top six majors are accounting, computer science, 
D  finance, business administration, mechanical engineering, and 
D  information sciences and systems.
D  NACE employer surveys indicate that, beyond grade-point averages, 
D  employers often see leadership skills as a tiebreaker between two 
D  equally qualified candidates.
D  </CS>[/KERN-3]Teamwork ability, written communication skills, and 
D  problem-solving are also important, as are verbal skills and work 
D  ethic.
D  For college graduates entering the job market, the opportunity for 
D  personal growth, job security, and friendly coworkers are all more 
D  important than a high starting salary, based on NACE student 
D  surveys.

D  Several companies reported earnings and outlooks that offered a 
D  mixed picture of the economy for investors. 
D  Health-care stocks were among the biggest decliners, dragged down 
D  after UnitedHealth Group cut its full-year earnings forecast. 
D  Traders felt a bit better about payments company Square and online 
D  dating site operator Match Group. Both soared on their first day 
D  of trading. Square, known for its white, cube-shaped credit and 
D  debit card readers that plug into smartphones, gained $4.07, or 
D  45.2 percent, to $13.07. Match, owner of online dating portals 
D  Tinder, Match.com, and OKCupid, climbed $2.74, or 22.8 percent, to 
D  $14.74.
D  [KERN-3]In the absence of major economic news, investors homed in 
D  on the uneven company earnings and outlooks. 
D  “That’s why we are[/KERN-3] largely without a lot of vigor in 
D  either direction today,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio 
D  manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. 
D  All told, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.41 points, or 
D  0.02 percent, to 17,732.75. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index 
D  slipped 2.34 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,081.24.
D  The Nasdaq composite lost 1.56 points, or 0.03 percent, to 
D  5,073.64. 
D  Stocks got off to a plodding start early Thursday, spending much 
D  of the morning hovering close to the levels from a day earlier, 
D  when the S&P 500 index posted its biggest gain in four weeks. 
D  The Labor Department’s latest weekly tally of unemployment benefit 
D  applications provided some good, if expected, insight into the job 
D  market. Applications for unemployment aid dropped last week to a 
D  seasonally adjusted 271,000. The four-week average, a less 
D  volatile measure, increased 3,000 to 270,750. 
D  Benchmark U.S. crude fell 21 cents to $40.54 a barrel on the New 
D  York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international 
D  oils, rose 4 cents to $44.18 a barrel in London. 
D  Precious and industrial metals prices were mixed. Gold rose $9.20 
D  to $1,077.90 an ounce, silver gained 14 cents to $14.22 an ounce 
D  and copper was essentially flat at $2.08 a pound. 
D  Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 
D  2.24 percent from 2.27 percent late Wednesday.

D  <WC1>Pfizer Said Near Allergan Deal Even as Treasury Eyes 
D  Inversions
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Cynthia Koons, <WC><QA0>
D  <WC1>Ed Hammond<WC>,<WC1> and Ruth David<WC>
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]<WC1>BLOOMBERG NEWS<WC>
D  [/BYCREDIT]<WC1>Pfizer Inc. is in advanced talks to buy Allergan 
D  Plc for as much as $380 <WC>a<WC1> share, <WC>sources say<WC1>, 
D  valuing the Botox maker at<WC> <WC1>as high as $150 billion — if 
D  the U.S. government doesn’t get in the way of<WC> <WC1>the drug 
D  industry’s largest-ever deal.
D  The companies aim to announce an agreement as soon as Monday<NO1>
D  <WC>cq<NO><WC1>, <WC>say the sources<WC1>, <WC>who asked to not be 
D  <WC1>identified because the discussions are private. The price 
D  being<WC> <WC1>discussed is $370 to $380 <WC>a<WC1> share, t<WC>
D  hey say<WC1>. However, the U.S. Treasury<WC> <WC1>Department’s 
D  letter on tax inversion deals, released on Wednesday<NO1><WC>cq<NO>
D  <WC1>, could delay the final agreement and change the terms of any 
D  transaction.
D  <WC>T<WC1>he<WC> <WC1>letter<WC> <WC1>said the department is 
D  reviewing ways to address overseas<WC> <WC1>acquisitions and plans 
D  to issue guidance later this week.
D  There ha<WC>s<WC1> been a flurry of pharma and biotech mergers 
D  this year, already surpassing last year’s record of $220 billion 
D  in deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
D  Buying Allergan, which has its legal domicile in Dublin, could let 
D  New<WC> <WC1>York-based Pfizer relocate outside the U<WC>nited 
D  States<WC1> for tax purposes, a transaction known as an 
D  inversion.<WC> Pfizer has a significant operation in 
D  Collegeville.<WC1>
D  [KERN+3]“We struggle to see what the Treasury can do to 
D  specifically curb” a combination of the two companies, Citigroup 
D  Inc. analysts said in a note Wednesday. Still, the<WC> <WC1>
D  “political noise” that would surround Pfizer’s relocation 
D  “constitutes the most<WC> <WC1>material hurdle to consummation of 
D  a transaction of this nature.”
D  [/KERN+3]Chances of the deal going through hinge more on “what 
D  price Allergan<WC> i<WC1>s willing to take and also, we don’t know 
D  if there<WC> i<WC1>s pressure from the White House in the<WC> <WC1>
D  background,<WC>”<WC1> Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, 
D  said by phone. The Treasury<WC> <WC1>Department doesn’t have power 
D  to block an inversion, but it could reduce the economic benefits 
D  of such a deal, he said.
D  [KERN+3]A deal at $380 per share would be the largest acquisition 
D  this year in any industry and would surpass Pfizer’s $116 billion 
D  purchase of Warner-Lambert Co. in 2000 as the<WC> <WC1>
D  biggest-ever transaction between drug companies, the 
D  Bloomberg-compiled data<WC> <WC1>show. <WC>
D  <WC1>Representatives for Allergan and Pfizer declined to 
D  commen[/KERN+3][KERN+2]t.
D  [/KERN+2]The transaction would strengthen Pfizer’s brand-name drug 
D  business and could pave the way for an eventual split in two. 
D  Allergan’s market value of $122 billion could also<WC> <WC1>allow 
D  the U.S. drugmaker to transfer its headquarters to Ireland. The 
D  move<WC> <WC1>requires a large foreign target in order to clear 
D  U.S. tax rules, and was one of the reasons Pfizer sought to 
D  acquire AstraZeneca Plc last year, before eventually 
D  withdrawing<WC> <WC1>its proposal.
D  <NO1>The Treasury Department is reviewing ways to address these 
D  overseas acquisitions and plans to issue guidance to reduce the 
D  economic benefits of tax<WC> <WC1>inversions, Secretary Jack Lew 
D  said in the letter Wednesday to Senator Ron Wyden, the<WC> <WC1>
D  Oregon Democrat who’s the ranking member on the Finance Committee.
D  
D  <NO>The Treasury Department has attempted to deal with inversions 
D  before, issuing a notice in September 2014 to make it harder for 
D  U.S. companies to borrow against their<WC> <WC1>foreign cash to 
D  finance inversions. <NO1>The Treasury proposal last year impacted 
D  a<WC> <WC1>handful of pending deals, but not all of them.

D  [WEBTAGS]<NO1>commentary<NO>[/WEBTAGS][DROP5F]Paris was for all 
D  Americans, but especially for Republicans, a summons to 
D  seriousness that should have two immediate impacts on the 
D  Republican presidential contest. It should awaken the party’s 
D  nominating electorate from its reveries about treating the 
D  presidency as an entry-level job. And it should cause Republicans 
D  to take another look at Chris Christie, beginning with his speech 
D  in Florida the day after the Paris attacks.
D  [KERN-1]Until now, many Republicans have been treating the 
D  nominating process as a mechanism for sending a message to 
D  Washington. The eruption of war in the capital of a NATO ally is a 
D  reminder that the nominating process will potentially send a 
D  commander in chief to Washington. This might, and should, hasten 
D  the eclipse of Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, and especially Donald 
D  Trump. His coarse, vulgar, and nasty 95-minute effusion last week 
D  in Fort Dodge, Iowa, answered this question: When he begins to 
D  fade, will he draw upon a hitherto well-hidden capacity for 
D  graciousness, or will he become a caricature of his normal 
D  persona, which itself is a caricature of democracy’s most 
D  embarrassing possibilities?
D  [/KERN-1]Watch Trump on YouTube (http://ow.ly/ULbFW), and consider 
D  his manner in light of his stupendously unconservative proposal, 
D  made one day earlier, of a federal police force. (It would conduct 
D  about 500,000 deportations a month to remove approximately 11.4 
D  million illegal immigrants in two years.) Then watch Christie on 
D  YouTube (http://ow.ly/ULc5P), and pay particular attention to his 
D  affirmation of the foundational conservative belief in the 
D  indispensability, the sovereignty, and the prerogatives of 
D  nationhood.
D  [KERN-1]To the large extent that Trump’s appeal is his forceful 
D  persona, no candidate in the Republican field can match Christie’s 
D  combination of a prosecutor’s bearing and a governor’s executive 
D  temperament. In Florida, Christie sounded a new theme: “There are 
D  all too many people in academia and in global business that aren’t 
D  really interested in America as a nation-state anymore.”
D  [/KERN-1]A day after the Paris attacks, outside the theater that 
D  was targeted, a German musician, seated at a grand piano bearing 
D  the peace symbol cherished by people who thought the Cold War was 
D  not worth winning, played John Lennon’s saccharine “Imagine,” 
D  which includes this:
D  <EM><QC>
D  [ITALIC]Imagine there’s no countries
D  It isn’t hard to do
D  Nothing to kill or die for ...[/ITALIC]
D  <EM><QC>
D  Right. Just one big happy caliphate. Lennon, as bad a political 
D  thinker as he was a grammarian, never learned this: Countries, 
D  meaning nation-states, are, for all their shortcomings and 
D  dangers, indispensable for making self-government possible and 
D  secure.
D  Heightened security concerns might be Christie’s opportunity. The 
D  more disorderly the world becomes, the less luminous is the one 
D  credential that supposedly qualifies Hillary Clinton for the 
D  presidency. The credential is not her adequate but unremarkable 
D  eight-year Senate career. Rather, it is her four years as 
D  secretary of state. Recall the question Ronald Reagan posed to 
D  voters at the conclusion of his single debate with President Jimmy 
D  Carter a week before the 1980 election: Are you better off today 
D  than you were four years ago? The electorate’s answer was 
D  emphatic.
D  In a debate 10 months from now, the Republican nominee will ask a 
D  variant of Reagan’s question: Is America safer or more respected 
D  today, anywhere in the world, than it was when Clinton became 
D  secretary of state? Today, Republican voters need to ask 
D  themselves a question: Whom do they want on stage asking that 
D  question? It is beyond peculiar, it is political malpractice for 
D  Republicans to fritter away time and attention on candidates who, 
D  innocent of governing experience, cannot plausibly ask that 
D  question with properly devastating effect.
D  For an example of pluperfect unseriousness, consider this Trump 
D  claim, which is amazingly absurd even considering the source: “I 
D  got to know \[Putin\] very well because we were both on [ITALIC]60 
D  Minutes[/ITALIC], we were stablemates, and we did very well that 
D  night.” They were not in the same stable; they were not in the 
D  same green room; they were not on the same continent. Trump was in 
D  a [ITALIC]60 Minutes[/ITALIC] segment taped in Manhattan; Putin 
D  was in another segment, taped eight time zones away in Moscow. Yet 
D  somehow Trump “got to know him very well.”
D  Every day that such errant nonsense sloshes through the Republican 
D  nominating debate is a day when the party’s claim to represent 
D  what the country craves — adult supervision — becomes less 
D  credible. Fortunately, sufficient days remain for Republicans to 
D  reshuffle the deck, to relegate Trump’s rampaging to the nation’s 
D  mental attic, and to recognize in Christie a serious political 
D  talent.

D  Botzman
D  [/BYLINE_CUR][EL5][DROP3F]It should come as no surprise to you 
D  when I say that higher education is increasingly competitive. That 
D  competition comes in many forms, though, depending on the size of 
D  the institution and the playing field.
D  Any collegiate sports fan knows that large private schools and 
D  state-owned and state-related colleges and universities compete 
D  for student athletes across the spectrum, from field hockey to 
D  lacrosse and from the gridiron to track and field. These same 
D  teaching and research institutions also work hard to attract the 
D  brightest students to their plethora of academic programs.
D  [KERN+1]Misericordia University and many other similarly sized 
D  private institutions also compete for student athletes and the 
D  best and brightest students, but on a much smaller or personal 
D  scale. So what attracts students to institutions like Misericordia 
D  that cannot offer exposure on the scale of ESPN’s [/KERN+1][ITALIC]
D  College GameDay[/ITALIC]?
D  Our distinctiveness is the separator, as it identifies who we are 
D  and what we want to be known for in the academic community. It is 
D  a good thing that Misericordia University offers a distinctive 
D  education, as Moody’s recently released a report that forecasts a 
D  tripling of small-college closings by 2017.
D  Given that only a handful of colleges close annually, we can 
D  safely assume that they are predicting about a dozen closures. 
D  There are 1,726 U.S. colleges and universities with between 1,000 
D  and 5,000 students. There are also many colleges with fewer than 
D  1,000 students, many of which specialize in serving a market 
D  niche.
D  Amit Mrig of Forbes notes that small colleges can control their 
D  destiny if they so choose. A key, according to the article, will 
D  be to establish a competitive advantage or, in simpler terms, do 
D  something so well that it is difficult or impossible to imitate.
D  At Misericordia University, we do things that will make us viable 
D  and relevant 150 years from now because we live our mission by 
D  “fostering intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and respect 
D  for persons in an environment where all are welcome.”
D  As a modern university, we not only foster intellectual curiosity 
D  and transmit knowledge through outstanding teaching; we create 
D  knowledge through our research and scholarship. Our student 
D  research fellowships, for example, provide students with 
D  opportunities to link classroom teaching to real-world challenges. 
D  Students have recently identified routes to remove heavy metals 
D  from water through biological methods, discovered brain “heat 
D  maps” that can improve language acquisition and ability, and 
D  created a digital history of local communities.
D  We also focus on critical thinking about academic and real-world 
D  topics, challenging and evaluating the assumptions that lead to 
D  our beliefs.
D  Our students and faculty engage in more than 70 courses that 
D  feature a service-learning curriculum. The classroom material is 
D  directly translated into practice in a real-world setting. 
D  Students learn about occupational therapy and use their skills to 
D  give real people, both locally and internationally, opportunities 
D  to once again engage in activities that many of us take for 
D  granted, such as walking or feeding oneself.
D  Our 3,200 students last year contributed more than 193,000 hours 
D  of service to others, much of it based on the critical thinking 
D  introduced by our faculty. We turn classroom theory into both 
D  policy and practice, guaranteeing that we engage critical thinking 
D  skills that can change the world for the better.
D  We also continually challenge our campus community to respect 
D  people in an environment where all are welcome.
D  [KERN-2]As an institution created to serve the daughters of coal 
D  miners, we have always been about access to higher education. We 
D  continue that tradition with the inclusion of nearly 800 students 
D  on federal financial assistance, more than 100 with documented 
D  learning challenges, and 10 women and 12 children in the Ruth 
D  Matthews Bourger Women With Children Program. Each of our students 
D  is presented with an opportunity to engage in a course of learning 
D  that leads to a better life for the student and for those who work 
D  and live in our communities through our service efforts.
D  [/KERN-2]Our mission demands that we seek those who need to be 
D  welcomed to higher education and provide them with access to the 
D  best teaching, research, and service experiences we can provide.
D  I will not be president of Misericordia University in 2165, but I 
D  firmly believe that we are on the correct path to be relevant and 
D  viable, while also serving others both today and many years from 
D  now.

D  [DROP5F]The Philadelphia Mara[/DROP5F]thon offers runners a survey 
D  of the multifaceted beauty of the city and the kind of supportive 
D  spectators who might just hand them a (small) beer at mile 20 in 
D  Manayunk, when they could really use one. In recent years, the 
D  race has gained runners, profits, and sponsorship. In the spirit 
D  of distance running, however, the city should be asking whether it 
D  can go farther.
D  It almost certainly can. In ways that don’t affect the experience 
D  of most runners but should matter to a city that needs every 
D  available economic boost, the race isn’t keeping up.
D  The marathon, half-marathon, and 8K, all held on one weekend, have 
D  grown more than 70 percent since 2008, as Philly.com noted this 
D  week, reaching 31,000 runners in 2014. The marathon was the 
D  nation’s eighth-largest 26.2-mile run last year, according to 
D  Running USA, behind blockbusters such as New York and Boston as 
D  well as also-rans like Honolulu and Disney World. Philadelphia’s 
D  half-marathon ranked 20th among 13.1-milers, outpaced by races in 
D  San Diego, Indianapolis, and Pittsburgh.
D  [KERN+1]The Philadelphia runs made the city $1.4 million more than 
D  they cost last year, Philly.com reported, a victory of sorts given 
D  that they lost money in two of the past seven years. But recent 
D  estimates of the event’s economic impact, ranging from about $10 
D  million to $20 million, suggest it’s hitting a wall: The top 
D  American marathons generate 10 times as much economic activity. 
D  Sure, Philadelphia can’t compete with the tradition of Boston’s 
D  race or the size of New York’s, but it could come closer.
D  [/KERN+1]For proof, consider Philly’s own Broad Street Run, which 
D  has become a remarkable success. The springtime 10-miler, 
D  sponsored by Independence Blue Cross, was the sixth-largest race 
D  of any distance in the country last year, according to Running 
D  USA. The Philadelphia Marathon, by contrast, was 76th overall — 
D  just ahead of the Madison, Wis., Crazylegs Classic and well behind 
D  the Buffalo, N.Y., Turkey Trot.
D  Philadelphia’s underperformance could be attributable partly to 
D  its rather Philadelphian approach to the race: It’s the only major 
D  American marathon run by the city itself. Most of the rest are 
D  handled by nonprofits.
D  Moreover, the marathon is managed by the Office of the City 
D  Representative, a mayoral appointee with a host of marketing and 
D  special-events duties. This quirky arrangement allows marathon 
D  profits (when there are any) to be spent on causes favored by the 
D  mayor, some of which are perfectly worthy. But it doesn’t seem to 
D  have maximized the race’s benefits for the city at large.
D  While the Broad Street Run is also a city event, it’s managed by a 
D  dedicated race director in the Parks and Recreation Department. 
D  Inquirer running columnist Jen A. Miller has argued persuasively 
D  that if the marathon isn’t turned over to a nonprofit, it could at 
D  least benefit from management by the team that made Broad Street 
D  famous.
D  The thousands of individual triumphs that constitute the marathon 
D  will no doubt make Sunday’s race another great event for the city. 
D  That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t strive — as every marathoner does — 
D  to be better.

D  [WEBTAGS]<NO1>commentary<NO>[/WEBTAGS][BYLINE_CUR]By B.G. Kelley
D  [/BYLINE_CUR][EL5][DROP3F]A[KERN+2]s Thanksgiving approaches, and 
D  as the full flame of autumn has passed, I am grateful for the 
D  chrysanthemums that dressed up lawns and gardens, filled homes and 
D  porches, and were arranged agreeably at the entrances to banks and 
D  apartment complexes in a variety of colors — yellows and purples, 
D  reds and oranges, fuchsias and golds. For sure, this flag-bearer 
D  flower of fall is relentlessly stunning, if not relentlessly 
D  lifting.
D  After many years of working around and with this flower, I think I 
D  know, with some certainty, the character of the chrysanthemum.
D  Succinctly, the mum, as the chrysanthemum is sometimes shortened 
D  to, speaks to powers that are at the very essence of our lives: It 
D  inspires unseen energy by assaulting and expanding our senses; it 
D  invokes a hearty trust by never coming up pale; it can even change 
D  us in some profound way, perhaps our perceptions or values, the 
D  same as a meaningful mural does, by helping to soften the sharp 
D  edges of life’s demands and commands. [/KERN+2]
D  [KERN+2]Its roots in America sprout from a spiritual seed. In 
D  1884, the Enomoto brothers of Redwood City, Calif., grew the first 
D  chrysanthemums in this country for the All Saints Day celebration. 
D  And since its symbolic presence promises happiness in life, maybe, 
D  just maybe, simply giving the chrysanthemum to someone we have 
D  differences with — perhaps in taste or temperament, politics or 
D  religion — can help to temper those differences. Go ahead, give 
D  that someone a chrysanthemum and see what I mean. It has worked 
D  for me more than once.
D  The mum also speaks a simple language that is in touch with most 
D  of us: It is not exotic or pricey, not pompous or haughty, not 
D  aloof or pretentious — not a blueblood flower.
D  [/KERN+2]It is the every-person flower. You can recognize 
D  yourself.
D  I know. I once sold the chrysanthemum — and other plants — outside 
D  a local department store in my every-person, middle-class 
D  neighborhood. There was no artifice to the people in my 
D  neighborhood nor to their  autumn flower preference: The 
D  chrysanthemum was the overwhelming favorite. I believe the people 
D  of my neighborhood recognized themselves in the flower.
D  It was pleasing to them in another way as well: They knew this 
D  reliable perennial expressed a sense of continuity in their lives; 
D  it would arrive again next autumn.
D  Just recently, as autumn’s rugged sun spilled down on the day, I 
D  walked out of my house and glanced at the gold and fuchsia 
D  chrysanthemums brightening the front of my home.
D  I felt something unmistakably warm. It was as intimate as a 
D  whisper.  I saw myself in the chrysanthemum.

D  [ITALIC]Give me your tired, your poor,

D  [FLUSH_RIGHT][BOLD]— Emma Lazarus[/BOLD][/FLUSH_RIGHT]
D  <EM>
D  [DROP5F]Truth be told, those time-honored words from the poem “The 
D  New Colossus,” which are engraved on a plaque inside the Statue of 
D  Liberty’s pedestal, never rang completely true. Often, this 
D  country has not welcomed immigrants, including refugees from 
D  war-torn regions. So it’s no surprise that 30 Republican 
D  governors, and one Democrat fighting for reelection, have vowed to 
D  block Syrian refugees from entering their states.[/DROP5F]
D  [KERN-1]Their recalcitrant response to the terrorist attack in 
D  Paris, which left more than 120 people dead, is based on the 
D  discovery of a Syrian passport apparently possessed by a terrorist 
D  who pretended to be a peaceful migrant to enter Europe. It makes 
D  sense to be more vigilant after the Paris attack, but that 
D  vigilance should be rooted in the principles that are supposed to 
D  define America, which include extending a hand to refugees fleeing 
D  strife.
D  [/KERN-1][KERN-1]All the knee-jerk, anti-immigrant rhetoric 
D  bandied about by self-serving politicians, including most of the 
D  Republican presidential candidates, brings to mind an equally 
D  odious chapter in history when this country denied entry to an 
D  ocean liner with Jewish refugees escaping Nazi Germany. You can 
D  find the story on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum website 
D  (www.ushmm.org).
D  [/KERN-1]In 1939, the [ITALIC][ROMAN]SS St. Louis[/ROMAN][/ITALIC] 
D  sailed from Hamburg to Havana with 937 mostly Jewish passengers, 
D  the majority of whom had applied for visas to stay in the United 
D  States. After Cuban President Federico Laredo Brú refused to honor 
D  the passengers’ landing certificates, the [ITALIC][ROMAN]St. 
D  Louis[/ROMAN][/ITALIC] sailed close enough to Miami to see its 
D  lights, but President Franklin D. Roosevelt would not respond to 
D  cables from the ship requesting refuge for its passengers. The 
D  ship was forced to return to Europe, where its passengers were 
D  dispersed in countries other than Germany. Most survived, but 
D  nearly 300 died in the Holocaust.
D  [KERN-2]Roosevelt’s turning a cold shoulder to the refugees aboard 
D  the [/KERN-2][KERN-1][ITALIC][ROMAN]St. Louis[/ROMAN][/ITALIC] 
D  reflected the prevailing attitude of Americans prior to this 
D  country’s entry into World War II. The Washington Post recently 
D  noted a poll published in a 1938 edition of Fortune magazine 
D  showing that less than 5 percent of Americans believed the 
D  immigration quotas that existed then should be raised to allow 
D  more refugees to enter the United States. In fact, two-thirds of 
D  those polled said steps should be taken to keep refugees out.
D  [/KERN-1]In a 1939 poll, 60 percent of Americans answered no when 
D  asked if the United States should permit 10,000 mostly Jewish 
D  children fleeing Germany to enter the country.
D  Mirroring the politicians of long ago, today’s governors who want 
D  to make their states off-limits to Syrian refugees are sensitive 
D  to polls that show 70 percent of Republican voters are “very 
D  concerned” about radical Islamists mixing with the U.S. 
D  population. About 46 percent of Democrats and 30 percent of 
D  independents have the same level of concern.
D  “Who in their right mind would want to bring over tens of 
D  thousands of Syrian refugees when we cannot determine, when the 
D  administration cannot determine, who is and isn’t a terrorist?” 
D  asked Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), perhaps the most conservative of 
D  the GOP presidential aspirants. His hyperventilating ignores that 
D  while no system is foolproof, the United States does have a very 
D  rigorous program to reduce the likelihood of a terrorist slipping 
D  in with legitimate refugees.
D  Indeed, the fact that it takes up to two years to complete the 
D  routine vetting process required under the U.S. Refugee Admissions 
D  Program’s rules to resettle in this country severely limits its 
D  ability to help abate the crisis that has flooded Europe with 
D  migrants. To argue that the process isn’t strict enough is a 
D  disingenuous attempt to exploit the understandable fears of 
D  Americans for personal political gain.
D  [KERN-1]That’s not the type of leadership this country needs. It 
D  sends the wrong message to disaffected Muslim youths in this 
D  country and elsewhere who may feel they have reason to believe the 
D  message of radical Islamists who tell them there is no place for 
D  them in America, who entice them to abandon their country and 
D  fight for an imaginary caliphate.
D  [/KERN-1]Years before he shunned the Jews aboard the [ITALIC]
D  [ROMAN]St. Louis,[/ROMAN][/ITALIC] [KERN-2]Roosevelt told 
D  Americans trying to survive the Depression that they had nothing 
D  to fear but fear itself. That message needs to resonate again 
D  today. This nation cannot get so caught up in its fear of 
D  terrorism that it stops being what it has been to the rest of the 
D  world since its birth, a country that shines a welcoming beacon on 
D  those yearning for freedom and a better life.

D  AP-US—Pollard-Spy Release, 2nd Ld-Writethru,518
D  US set to release Jonathan Pollard, who spied for Israel 
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By David B. Caruso
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]ASSOCIATED PRESS
D  [/BYCREDIT]NEW YORK — Former spy Jonathan Pollard is set to be 
D  released from a federal prison in North Carolina on Friday, 30 
D  years after he was caught selling American intelligence secrets to 
D  Israel. But he’ll be on a short leash as he rebuilds his life as a 
D  free man. 
D  Pollard, 61, was given a life sentence in 1987 in a case that has 
D  complicated diplomacy between the two countries. 
D  He<WC> i<WC1>s expected to settle in the New York area while he 
D  spends at least the next five years on parole. He will be barred 
D  from traveling outside the country, including to Israel, without 
D  permission. Many in Israel view him as a hero. 
D  Both the Justice Department and Pollard’s <WC>attorneys<WC1> have 
D  so far declined to discuss his parole conditions, but one longtime 
D  supporter, Rabbi Pesach Lerner of New York, told a radio 
D  interviewer this month that Pollard would have to abide by a 
D  curfew and wear a GPS unit to track his movements. 
D  He has also been ordered to stay off the Internet, Lerner said, 
D  which could complicate his ability to hold a job. 
D  “We’re concerned that maybe they are trying to set him up so they 
D  can say he broke his parole and send him back,” Lerner told Nachum 
D  Segal, who hosts a program on Jewish affairs on WFMU in New 
D  Jersey. “They’re keeping the reins on him very tightly.” 
D  Standard rules for federal parolees would also restrict Pollard’s 
D  travel within the U<WC>nited States.<WC1> 
D  Pollard’s <WC>attorneys<WC1>, Eliot Lauer and Jacques Semmelman, 
D  said in late July that they had secured employment and housing for 
D  him “in the New York area,” but they haven’t revealed any details. 
D  
D  <NO1>The details of when he will travel to New York, following his 
D  release from the federal prison in Butner, N<WC>.<WC1>C<WC>.<WC1>, 
D  or where he will be living and working, are still being kept 
D  private. 
D  <NO>Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has asked the 
D  U.S. to allow Pollard to move immediately to Israel, the 
D  pro-government Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom reported Thursday. 
D  [KERN-2]Two New York congressmen, Reps. Eliot Engel and Jerrold 
D  Nadler, have also written U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, 
D  saying that Pollard should be allowed to renounce his American 
D  citizenship and emigrate to Israel. 
D  [/KERN-2]<NO1>Pollard, a former civilian intelligence analyst for 
D  the Navy, was arrested in 1985. He pleaded guilty a year later. 
D  Over the decades, the possibility of his early release had been 
D  dangled as a bargaining chip in the Middle East peace process.

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]<NO1>PLS SEE NU AT BOTTOM<NO>An internal review by 
D  Lower Merion police has found no evidence of racial profiling or 
D  improper treatment by officers who detained a black man at a bus 
D  stop in October.
D  The report came late Wednesday in response to a complaint filed by 
D  the NAACP.
D  Nathaniel Williams Jr., 58, was on his way to a doctor’s 
D  appointment to have his pacemaker checked when Lower Merion 
D  officers forced him to get on his knees and handcuffed him, 
D  according to police. They were searching for a man who had just 
D  robbed the TD Bank down the street and said Williams matched the 
D  description.
D  The department said its officers acted appropriately and 
D  respectfully in questioning Williams.
D  “The investigating officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct an 
D  investigatory stop,” the statement said. “All procedures utilized 
D  at the scene of this encounter comply with the training and 
D  policies of the Police Department.”
D  The incident revived allegations of racial profiling in Lower 
D  Merion that included snow shovelers being detained in January, an 
D  officer who sued the department in 2011, and a suit alleging 
D  racially motivated redistricting by the school district.
D  [KERN-3]Dozens of black residents and their supporters attended 
D  <NO1>the<NO>a Nov. 4 police commission meeting to share personal 
D  anecdotes and the overall sense that blacks are treated as 
D  “second-class citizens,” as one man put it.
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-3]Some called for external reviews of complaints 
D  against officers, while others urged the department to switch to a 
D  community-based model of policing to foster closer relationships 
D  with the residents.
D  Police Superintendent Michael McGrath said Thursday that 
D  community-building efforts were continuing.
D  [/KERN-3]McGrath said the problem was not with how police acted, 
D  but rather a growing perception nationwide of police officers as 
D  racist or untrustworthy.
D  “The unfortunate misperceptions about police services are 
D  lingering, and that’s what we’re working on improving,” he said. 
D  “But it is a two-way street.”
D  [KERN-2]In Williams’ case, McGrath said, “the facts speak for 
D  themselves.”
D  According to the review, Williams matched the description of a man 
D  who had robbed the bank on Lancaster Avenue about 10 minutes 
D  earlier: a tall black male, 40 to 50 years old, wearing glasses 
D  and a hoodie, with no car. 
D  [/KERN-2][KERN-0]After officers searched his bag, and a bank 
D  employee confirmed that Williams was not the robber, he “was 
D  immediately unhandcuffed<NO1>CQ<NO> and his personal information 
D  was recorded for the investigative report,” according to the 
D  statement.
D  [/KERN-0][KERN-0]The entire detention lasted about four minutes, 
D  the report said.
D  [/KERN-0][KERN-2]<NO1>/nu/<NO>Diana Robertson, president of the 
D  NAACP’s Main Line chapter, said Thursday that she was satisfied 
D  with the response she received from the township and the police 
D  department, but that there are more issues to be addressed.
D  [/KERN-2]“Clearly the police have a job to do, and they do have a 
D  policy to ensure they’re secure and safe,” she said. “At the point 
D  you realize this probably isn’t your person and you have secured 
D  safety for yourself, are there any other alternatives to how you 
D  handle the situation?”
D  She said the department should continue to hold forums, adjust 
D  policies, and make people aware of what police protocols are so 
D  that they will not be terrified in a situation like Williams’.
D  [KERN-3]“That’s just very stressful. That’s extremely humiliating, 
D  and especially because of his medical condition, his thought 
D  being, ‘I just don't want them to kill me,’<TH>” she said. “That 
D  isn’t the thought that should be in someone's mind.”<NO1>
D  /endnu/<NO>
D  [/KERN-3]<NO1>Williams and his representatives did not immediately 
D  respond to requests for comment. At the Nov. 4 hearing, the Rev. 
D  James A. Pollard of Zion Baptist Church in Ardmore said Williams 
D  had been forced to wait on his knees until the bank employee 
D  cleared him.
D  “I’m asking for fairness and respect,” Pollard said, urging the 
D  department “to review policies of detention and search and 
D  seizure.”
D  The department’s report disputes Pollard’s account, saying that 
D  Williams “was immediately helped to his feet” once the handcuffs 
D  were applied and that he was not subjected to any rough 
D  treatment.<NO>McGrath said no policy or procedure changes were 
D  planned.

D  [WEBHEAD]Manayunk businessman gives Montco house to 
D  Habitat[/WEBHEAD]
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Matthew Nussbaum
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROPBLUE5]L<MC>enny Bazemore remembers heating pots of 
D  water on the stove to fill the bathtub. He remembers waiting his 
D  turn and bathing in dirty water. He remembers hunger. He remembers 
D  poverty.
D  “We didn’t have much, but we had love, we had family,” Bazemore 
D  said. “We didn’t have much, but we had each other.”
D  On Thursday, Bazemore, 46, now a successful businessman, sought to 
D  honor the family of his childhood best friend, who lived across 
D  the street in Norristown.
D  He had purchased the family’s home after the parents died, 
D  planning to flip it for a profit.
D  But he decided instead to donate it to Habitat for Humanity, to 
D  give an opportunity to another family.
D  “It feels amazing to preserve the name of the Henning family and 
D  do something good for Norristown,” Bazemore said after a 
D  ribbon-cutting Thursday in front of the two-story brick rowhouse. 
D  He said he remains friends with his childhood pal Curt Henning, 
D  and made the move to honor Curt’s parents, Bill and Janice 
D  Henning.
D  “This is it. This is where I’m from,” Bazemore said, stretching 
D  out his arms and surveying the block.
D  Even though he now lives on the Main Line, deals in real estate, 
D  and owns an art gallery and juice shop in Manayunk, he said, 
D  Norristown “will always be my home.”
D  “His roots were here; he still has friends here,” said Bazemore’s 
D  mother, Gwen, 65, who still lives in that home across West Basin 
D  Street and trusted that her son would always remember where he 
D  came from. “I knew he wouldn’t ever forget, because his mother’s 
D  still here.”
D  Bazemore’s gift fits into a broader effort undertaken by Habitat 
D  for Humanity.
D  “We have made a strategic decision to focus on revitalizing 
D  Norristown,” said Marianne Lynch, executive director of Habitat 
D  for Humanity of Montgomery County.
D  She estimated it will take about six months for volunteers, under 
D  the supervision of professionals, to renovate the home for its new 
D  occupants. The process will be much faster than usual, she said, 
D  because in addition to donating the house, which he bought last 
D  year for $5,000, Bazemore is kicking in $50,000 to fix it up.
D  She said the strong sense of community in the neighborhood was 
D  aiding Habitat’s efforts in revitalizing Norristown.
D  Bazemore’s mother echoed that sentiment.
D  “In our area, we always respected each other and looked after each 
D  other,” Gwen Bazemore said in the living room of the house her son 
D  had just donated. “And that’s still the way.”

D  <NO>By Tricia L. Nadolny
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]Nine members of Philadelphia City Council on Thursday 
D  signed a resolution urging District Attorney Seth Williams to fire 
D  three prosecutors entangled in the so-called Porngate scandal. The 
D  members also called on the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office 
D  to appoint an independent special prosecutor to investigate, 
D  adding their names to a growing group. 
D  “This is not something that’s going away,” said Councilwoman Cindy 
D  Bass, who introduced the resolution. “This is something that is 
D  really only gaining steam and gaining momentum.”
D  The resolution was introduced a week after the five female members 
D  of Council held a news conference making similar demands. Joining 
D  Bass in backing the resolution are Council members Jannie L. 
D  Blackwell, Blondell Reynolds Brown, W. Wilson Goode Jr., William 
D  Greenlee, Kenyatta Johnson, Curtis Jones Jr., Marian B. Tasco, and 
D  Maria Quiñones Sánchez. 
D  The resolution will likely be called up for a full vote next week; 
D  the support of nine of Council’s 14 members means it is likely to 
D  pass. 
D  Prosecutors Frank Fina, E. Marc Costanzo, and Patrick Blessington 
D  sent or received emails with pornographic content while working 
D  for the Attorney General’s Office.
D  Williams has said that the men, who now work for his office, have 
D  been disciplined and ordered to undergo sensitivity training. His 
D  office has not responded to repeated inquiries about whether that 
D  training took place and, if it has, what it entailed.
D  Bass on Thursday questioned why the office was “operating in such 
D  secrecy.”
D  “Who conducted it? When was it conducted? What kind of training 
D  was it?” Bass said. “These are all very valid questions that the 
D  citizens of the city of Philadelphia want to have answered. And we 
D  call on our district attorney to do the right thing and tell us.”
D  A spokesman for Williams did not respond to a request for comment 
D  on the resolution.

D  schools contract
D  <NO>[/WEBHEAD]<NO1><EM>
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Kristen A. Graham<QA0>
D  and Martha Woodall
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITERS
D  [/BYCREDIT]Despite months of missing goals and leaving classrooms 
D  unstaffed, the Cherry Hill firm charged with handling city 
D  schools’ substitute-teaching services will keep most of its 
D  Philadelphia School District work and not have its contract 
D  canceled, officials announced Thursday.
D  Going forward, Source4Teachers will staff only short-term 
D  substitute jobs; the district will again manage long-term 
D  substitute staffing. Many had called for the contract to be 
D  canceled outright.
D  On any given day in October, Philadelphia had more than 500 
D  short-term absences and vacancies for the firm to fill. At its 
D  high point, this week, Source4Teachers filled roughly 30 percent 
D  of the jobs.
D  It had promised to staff 70 percent of vacancies on the first day 
D  of school, and 90 percent by January.
D  Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said the district had 
D  outsourced substitute staffing because it was not doing an 
D  adequate job itself — last year, it managed to staff about 65 
D  percent of substitute jobs. For Philadelphia to take the bulk of 
D  the work back would be counterproductive, he suggested.
D  Hite, who had earlier said his patience had run out with 
D  Source4Teachers, acknowledged the firm had not measured up. But, 
D  he said, if the district canceled its Source4Teachers pact 
D  outright, it would lose the 265 teachers now in the sub pool and 
D  the 400 more awaiting clearances to work.
D  “Canceling the contract does not generate any savings,” Hite said 
D  in an email to staff. Source4Teachers “is only paid for the 
D  substitute positions it fills.”
D  Appearing before the School Reform Commission at a raucous meeting 
D  Thursday night, Source4Teachers president Kendley Davenport said 
D  the firm had to do better.
D  “I want to publicly acknowledge that we have underperformed,” 
D  Davenport said over the boos of a hostile crowd that expressed its 
D  displeasure all night with a cowbell, a tambourine, and jeers.
D  Still, Davenport said, the company was ramping up its efforts to 
D  recruit teachers, offering higher pay and investing in advertising 
D  campaigns.
D  “We’re confident that Source4Teachers is the right partner for the 
D  district,” Davenport said.
D  Jerry Jordan, president of the Philadelphia Federation of 
D  Teachers, said the district’s contract amendment did not go nearly 
D  far enough.
D  “The district needs to take control of assigning substitute 
D  teachers, totally,” said Jordan, whose union represented most 
D  substitutes under the old system.<NO1> “It’s been almost three 
D  months, and it’s been very clear that Source4Teachers has not been 
D  able to do the job.”<NO>
D  Speakers at the meeting also expressed outrage that the district 
D  did not cancel the Source4Teachers contract outright.
D  “There is no reason to continue to pay this company,” said Lisa 
D  Haver, a retired district teacher. “The decision not to cancel 
D  this contract is completely irresponsible. It is a betrayal of the 
D  students.”
D  The SRC did not need to act on the contract amendment. The 
D  commission did, however, take action on three charter schools.
D  It voted not to renew the charter of New Media Technology Charter 
D  School in the city’s Stenton section, a process begun in 2014. The 
D  SRC cited numerous reasons, including poor academic performance, 
D  financial problems, and failing to provide students with the rich 
D  technology experience promised in its application.
D  The school’s founding CEO and founding board president went to 
D  federal prison in 2012 after admitting they stole $522,000 in 
D  taxpayer money to prop up a restaurant, a health-food store, and a 
D  private school they controlled, and for defrauding a bank.
D  Community Academy of Philadelphia Charter School received a new 
D  charter, closing a protracted legal battle. The SRC had attempted 
D  to shut the North Philadelphia school down amid complaints about 
D  shaky finances and low test scores.
D  After three contentious SRC votes and a few forays to the courts, 
D  the state Charter Appeal Board ordered the SRC in May<NO1>2015<NO> 
D  to grant the K-12 school in Kensington a new charter.
D  <NO1>Attorneys for the district and Community spent months 
D  negotiating the agreement’s wording. Since the fight started over 
D  the school’s 2010 charter renewal, the school’s finances had 
D  stabilized and its academic performance improved.
D  <NO>After a close vote, Ad Prima Charter School, with campuses in 
D  Frankford and Kensington, saw its charter renewed with dozens of 
D  conditions. Ad Prima is one of four charters founded by Dorothy 
D  June Brown. The veteran educator is awaiting retrial on federal 
D  charges of defrauding some of her schools of $6.3 million.
D  <NO1>As was the case in the other recent renewals of charters 
D  Brown founded, Ad Prima was required to replace its CEO and 
D  several board members and to confirm it cut all ties with Brown 
D  and her companies and will not contract with her, pending the 
D  outcome of her retrial.
D  Commissioner Bill Green was opposed to renewing Ad Prima, saying 
D  that the SRC would be “renewing bad behavior” by granting a new 
D  charter.
D  The school had serious problems, and though it has met or is on 
D  its way to meeting most of the district’s conditions, “everybody 
D  complies when they’re facing nonrenewal,” Green said.
D  He and SRC Chair Marjorie Neff voted against the renewal, but yes 
D  votes from Sylvia Simms, Feather Houston, and Farah Jimenez 
D  assured the school’s fate.

D  [/BYCREDIT]STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Aiming to draw more students and 
D  stay competitive in the Philadelphia area, Pennsylvania State 
D  University is poised to spend more than $100 million to add a 
D  residence hall at its Abington campus, and a residence hall and 
D  student union at its Brandywine campus in Media.
D  Neither campus has residence halls, so the addition of housing has 
D  the potential to transform what have been satellite sites serving 
D  commuters into self-enclosed communities that could appeal to a 
D  wider swath of prospective students. Being just outside the city 
D  is part of the lure. 
D  “A lot of Philadelphia residents want to come to Penn State, and 
D  they would like to have that first experience in Philadelphia,” 
D  university president Eric Barron said. 
D  The projects won the backing of the PSU trustees’ finance 
D  committee Thursday. They go before the full board Friday. 
D  If approved, the residence halls could open as soon as 2017, said 
D  Ford Stryker, associate vice president for physical plant. The new 
D  student union would have dining services. 
D  The two campuses have since 2009 attracted increasing numbers of 
D  out-of-state students and international students, many who live in 
D  off-campus apartments, Stryker said. With 3,966 students, Abington 
D  is the third largest of Penn State’s 20 branch campuses.
D  The expansion plan there calls for a $50 million, 402-bed 
D  apartment-style residence hall along Old York Road, about a 
D  half-mile from the campus. The site, just down the road from the 
D  Abington Township Public Library, was most recently a car 
D  dealership. A shuttle would transport students to and from campus.
D  
D  During construction, “more than 100 full- or part-time jobs will 
D  be created with approximately $25 million in total economic 
D  impact,” Karen Wiley Sandler, chancellor of the campus, said in a 
D  statement. “Long-term, we expect nearly 50 new jobs to be 
D  established with an expected $5 million in economic impact.” 
D  Brandywine, the sixth-largest campus, with 1,457 students, would 
D  get a 256-bed residence hall behind its library. The price tag is 
D  $31.5 million. The plans also call for $20 million to be spent on 
D  a 31,000-square-foot student union with dining services, meeting 
D  rooms, a bookstore, recreational space, and other services. 
D  Stryker showed a map with other universities in the Philadelphia 
D  area that offer housing. He said not having residence halls puts 
D  Abington and Brandywine at a disadvantage.
D  University officials cited Pennsylvania Department of Education 
D  data that show the Abington and Brandywine areas combined are 
D  projected to enroll 28,000 high school seniors by 2021, the 
D  largest number of any region in the state.
D  Barron also said retention and graduation rates were better at 
D  campuses with housing. Students can get a sense of community and 
D  become more involved with the campus if they live there, he said.
D  Only one member of the finance committee opposed the construction. 
D  New trustee Elliott W. Weinstein questioned whether the university 
D  should be in the business of building and owning residence halls. 
D  
D  If the projects get final approval Friday, 10 of the 20 branch 
D  campuses will have on-campus housing. The others are Harrisburg, 
D  Erie, Altoona, Berks, Mont Alto, Hazleton, Beaver and Greater 
D  Allegheny.

D  Justice J. Michael Eakin poses for photographs with the court's

D  deferring action on explicit emails involving Eakin to the 
D  Judicial Conduct Board, which is currently investigating. The 
D  court issued a statement that said it was taking that approach 
D  based on the recommendation of a law firm it hired to review the

D  Eakin sent emails that included one depicting a topless woman and 
D  others with "purported jokes and banter that are offensive." (AP

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITERS
D  [/BYCREDIT]Pennsylvania  Supreme Court Justice J. Michael Eakin, 
D  responding to criticism that the Judicial Conduct Board had 
D  treated him too leniently in a review of his offensive emails, 
D  said Thursday that the panel should no longer play a role in 
D  investigating him.
D  Instead, Eakin recommended that his case be taken up by the six 
D  judges on the Court of Judicial Discipline, which weighs 
D  misconduct allegations against judges and hands out punishment.
D  “In an effort to alleviate any mistrust of the process, I have 
D  asked the Judicial Conduct Board to forgo further deliberation of 
D  this matter and remove the matter to the Court of Judicial 
D  Discipline immediately,” the justice said in a brief statement.
D  Eakin, a Republican who has served on the high court since 2002, 
D  pointed out that the Court of Judicial Discipline hears evidence 
D  publicly, which he said “would assure public confidence.”
D  The Judicial Conduct Board, by contrast, operates in secrecy, he 
D  noted. And, Eakin said, the panel’s staff and board members now 
D  face “unfortunate and wholly misguided accusations” about how they 
D  had handled his case.
D  Last week, The Inquirer reported that a member of the conduct 
D  board had <NO1>himself <NO>received <NO1>/<NO>similar<NO1>/<NO> 
D  offensive emails from a former Supreme Court justice.
D  Days before that, the Philadelphia Daily News reported that board 
D  counsel Robert Graci had worked on Eakin’s <NO1>/<NO>judicial<NO1>
D  /last<NO> campaign and was a longtime <NO1>Eakin<NO>friend <NO1>
D  /<NO>of the justice<NO1>/<NO>’s.
D  Eakin’s proposal immediately faced strong criticism.
D  Ronald D. Castille, the court’s former chief justice, and others 
D  noted that under the state c<NO1>C<NO>onstitution, the Judicial 
D  Conduct Board serves as the prosecutorial<NO1>prosecuting<NO> arm 
D  of the Court of Judicial Discipline. The board investigates 
D  potential misconduct, drafts <NO1>a <NO>complaint<NO1>/<NO>s<NO1>
D  /<NO>, and presents <NO1>/<NO>them<NO1>/it<NO> to the six judges.
D  If the conduct board were cut out of that process, he asked, who 
D  would perform that job? “Somebody has to present the cases to the 
D  court,” he said.
D  Castille repeated his call for a special prosecutor to investigate 
D  not only Eakin but <NO1>//<NO>others in the legal system involved 
D  in the exchange of troubling emails. Moreover, in a stand endorsed 
D  Wednesday by the Philadelphia Bar Association, Castille said an 
D  independent investigator should examine how <NO1>/<NO>Attorney 
D  General Kathleen G. Kane<NO1>/<NO>, the Supreme Court, and the 
D  conduct board responded to the porn allegations in the first 
D  place.
D  Kane discovered last year that her office’s computer system<NO1>
D  servers<NO> had served for years as a hub for the exchange of 
D  X-rated emails. The messages circulated among state and federal 
D  prosecutors, judges, detectives, and members of the defense bar. 
D  Lynn Marks, who directs the reform-oriented Pennsylvanians for 
D  Modern Courts, said she was worried that Eakin was calling for a 
D  process that might truncate a more detailed investigation. 
D  The Judicial Conduct Board, as well as Eakin’s colleagues on the 
D  Supreme Court, first reviewed his <NO1>Eakin’s<NO>emails last year 
D  and cleared him of wrongdoing, dismissing his messages as “mildly 
D  pornographic” and “unremarkable.”
D  <NO1>State Attorney General Kathleen <NO>Kane punctured that last 
D  month, making public <NO1>/<NO>some of the justice’s emails <NO1>
D  Eakin material <NO>that she said were sexually explicit, 
D  misogynistic, or <NO1>/<NO>racist<NO1>mocking of minorities<NO>.
D  While making public the emails of Eakins and a handful of others, 
D  Kane has never fully disclosed all email recipients and senders. 
D  On Thursday, Commonwealth Court ruled that Kane could make all 
D  such emails public on her own authority, but that the state’s 
D  Right-to-Know law does not make <NO1>/<NO>such<NO1>/<NO> a release 
D  mandatory. 
D  In its second investigation of Eakin, made public this month, a 
D  new expert hired by the Supreme Court found that Eakin had sent or 
D  received about 1,000 emails captured by the attorney general’s 
D  computer servers between 2008 and 2014. Kane flagged about 65 as 
D  offensive.
D  Of the troubling emails, Eakin was the recipient in a heavy 
D  majority, and the sender in only a handful<NO1>, perhaps five<NO>.
D  
D  In the end, the high court decided this month to leave any 
D  discipline in the hands of the Judicial Conduct Board.
D  Eakin, 66, has apologized and said the emails do not reflect his 
D  character.
D  Eakin’s emails surfaced because he exchanged messages with a 
D  friend who was a deputy attorney general, using his friend’s work 
D  email address.
D  While Kane has made some of his emails public as well as those of 
D  a handful of other officials, she has yet to provide with a full 
D  breakdown of all recipients.
D  In its ruling Thursday, Commonwealth Court concluded that the 
D  emails were personal in nature, and therefore should not be 
D  considered public records under the Right-to-Know law. The ruling 
D  rebuffed a lawsuit filed by The Inquirer.
D  While stopping short of making a release mandatory, the court 
D  wrote: “We want to make clear that we are only stating that the 
D  \[Right-to-Know law\] does not compel her to release the requested 
D  emails.” It added, “Nothing in this opinion precludes her from 
D  releasing” them.
D  Kane spokesman Chuck Ardo said Thursday that Kane, a Democrat, 
D  will review the court’s decision and issue a statement on what her 
D  next steps will be by Wednesday<NO1>11/25<NO>.
D  That is the day a key report is due by a Senate committee 
D  exploring whether to remove Kane from office because <NO1>/<NO>her 
D  license to practice law has been suspended by the Supreme 
D  Court<NO1>she lacks an active law license<NO>.
D  The court<NO1>state Supreme Court<NO> temporarily suspended 
D  Kane’s  license <NO1>to practice law<NO>after she was charged with 
D  perjury, official oppression, and other crimes. Prosecutors say 
D  Kane illegally leaked confidential information to a newspaper and 
D  then lied about it under oath.
D  She has pleaded not guilty and <NO1>/<NO>vowed to remain in 
D  office. Kane insists that <NO1>said <NO>she does not need an 
D  active law license to <NO1>/<NO>carry out her duties as the 
D  state’s highest-ranking law enforcement official<NO1>serve<NO>.
D  <NO1>In the court fight over the porn, attorneys for The Inquirer 
D  had argued that the emails are public. because they document how 
D  the agency’s employees, including some of its former top 
D  prosecutors and agents, routinely and over several years used 
D  taxpayer resources and time.
D  Terry Mutchlercq, a /lawyer Pepper Hamilton attorney who 
D  represented the newspaper, on said the ruling paved the way for 
D  Kane to make good on her publicly-stated position to make the 
D  emails available for public review as soon as possible.
D  “The Right to Know law is designed to scrutinize the actions of 
D  public officials,” said Mutchler, who for six years headed the 
D  state’s Open Records office. 
D  She added: “At end of the day, The Inquirer believed that the 
D  public should be able to see what public officials were trading in 
D  pornographic, misogynistic and racist emails on state time.”

D  [/BYCREDIT]The Philadelphia Water Department will launch a 
D  discount program for low-income residents under legislation passed 
D  Thursday by City Council.
D  The bill, which Mayor Nutter’s office has said he will sign, lays 
D  the foundation for income-based billing and debt-forgiveness 
D  options. The program could be operational by summer 2017. 
D  “Some of us feel that water is a right and that everyone should 
D  have access to it,” Councilwoman Maria Quiñones Sánchez, who 
D  introduced the bill, said on the Council floor after it passed 
D  Thursday. 
D  Water affordability is a pressing problem in Philadelphia, where 
D  40 percent of payers are behind on their bills and delinquent 
D  payments total $259 million.
D  The department’s current low-income program offers debt-payment 
D  plans as well as annual grants for approved payers — often a few 
D  hundred dollars — spread over monthly bills. Just 7,200 payers are 
D  enrolled (as opposed to 61,000 enrolled in a similar program 
D  offered by the Philadelphia Gas Works), due in part to high 
D  barriers to entry, advocates say.
D  The details of the program will be hashed out under the 
D  administration of Mayor-elect Jim Kenney. But the legislation 
D  passed Thursday requires that it <NO1>provide income-based bills 
D  that<NO>base a household’s <NO1>/<NO>bill<NO1>/<NO> payments on 
D  its annual income. 
D  The legislation allows for the department to offer debt 
D  forgiveness to those with overdue bills who pay on time going 
D  forward.
D  <NO1>nu/added<NO>It's still unknown if the new program will result 
D  higher rates for Philadelphians who aren't enrolled. Quiñones 
D  Sánchez has said she believes the program can be instituted 
D  without resulting in a rates increase, in part because making 
D  bills more affordable will increase overall compliance. But water 
D  department officials have said they expect the program will result 
D  in a rate increase. <NO1>end/nu<NO>
D  The program will be open to those at up to 150 percent of the 
D  federal poverty level, or $36,375 for a family of four. Those up 
D  to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or $60,625 for a 
D  family of four, will be eligible for a discount similar to the one 
D  currently offered by the Water Department.
D  “Far too many of our clients are living without water,” said Rob 
D  Ballenger of Community Legal Services, which advocates for and 
D  represents poor Philadelphians. “This is of tremendous 
D  significance and importance to our low-income clients.”
D  Council members also took the following actions Thursday:
D  [RD_BULLETS]Quiñones Sánchez criticized the anticipated city 
D  decision to roll back the policy barring city police and prison 
D  officials from cooperating with federal Immigration and Customs 
D  Enforcement agents. 
D  [/RD_BULLETS]Nutter instituted the “sanctuary city” policy by 
D  executive order in 2014. Officials have proposed a new policy that 
D  would allow local-federal cooperation if a suspect is accused of 
D  murder, rape, robbery, domestic violence, illegal possession of a 
D  firearm, or involvement in terrorism.
D  Quiñones Sánchez, in a speech on the Council floor, questioned why 
D  Nutter, “when he’s wrapping up in the last few weeks, feels the 
D  need” to make a change. 
D  “It really sets us back,” she said.
D  [RD_BULLETS]Council passed legislation, introduced by Kenyatta 
D  Johnson, that will add an additional $2 million to the city’s 
D  Housing Trust Fund, which provides grants to eligible homeowners 
D  for home repairs aimed at energy conservation.

D  [WEBHEAD]Former district judge’s appeal of jail term 
D  denied[/WEBHEAD]

D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Michaelle Bond
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT][EL2]The <NO1>state’s<NO>Pennsylvania Superior Court 
D  has denied the appeal of a former Chester County district judge 
D  who hoped for a shorter sentence than the 16 to 32 months in state 
D  prison she received for hiding a citation against her son.
D  [EL2]Lawyers for Rita Arnold, 59, of Downingtown, said they 
D  planned to ask the court to reconsider the decision.
D  [KERN-0][EL2]“We continue to feel that sentencing a first-time 
D  offender who pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and is suffering 
D  from an aggressive form of cancer constitutes cruel and unusual 
D  punishment, and we hope other Superior Court judges will agree,” 
D  said Nicholas D. Ressetar, Arnold’s attorney.
D  [/KERN-0][EL2]Ressetar said Arnold spent about a week in state 
D  prison before being released on $100,000 bail. At the time, she 
D  had just had a double mastectomy, Ressetar said.
D  [EL2]Arnold’s appeal to a three-judge panel argued that a 
D  Philadelphia judge failed to consider that Arnold was receiving 
D  treatment for breast cancer and had a previously clean criminal 
D  record.
D  [KERN+3][EL2]The appeal also argued that the judge handed down a 
D  sentence more than twice as long as the state sentencing 
D  guidelines to make an example of Arnold.
D  [/KERN+3][EL2]Superior Court ruled this week that the Common Pleas 
D  Court judge who heard the case did not abuse his discretion “in 
D  finding that a judicial officer is held to high ethical and legal 
D  standards.”
D  [EL2]The Superior Court judges also found that Arnold’s cancer 
D  treatments and prior record had been taken into account.
D  [KERN-0][EL2]“The sentencing court simply did not afford those 
D  facts more weight than what it considered were aggravating 
D  circumstances,” the court said.
D  [/KERN-0][KERN-0][EL2]Arnold pleaded guilty to obstructing justice 
D  and tampering with evidence in June 2013.
D  [EL2]In January 2010, Arnold’s two adult sons got into a fight, 
D  and the state police issued a citation to one son, who was on 
D  probation at the time.
D  [EL2]Arnold told one of her employees not to file the citation and 
D  hid it for weeks to protect her son from sanctions from the 
D  county’s probation department, according to court records.
D  [EL2]When Arnold did file the citation in April 2010, she did not 
D  follow protocol for transferring the case. She also listed an 
D  incorrect birth date in court records and said the defendant was a 
D  black female, according to court filings.
D  [EL2]The irregularities with the citation led to an investigation 
D  by the Judicial Conduct Board and criminal charges against Arnold.
D  
D  [EL2]She resigned from the bench in April 2013 and was sentenced 
D  to prison in October 2013.

D  [WEBHEAD]Pa. House vote on medical marijuana could be 
D  soon[/WEBHEAD][WEBTAGS]local,breaking,inqfrontpage[/WEBTAGS]
D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Chris Palmer
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER HARRISBURG BUREAU
D  [/BYCREDIT]HARRISBURG — After years of discussion, Pennsylvania 
D  lawmakers appear poised to cast a historic vote next week that 
D  could legalize medical marijuana.
D  As soon as Monday, legislators in the House could vote on a 
D  measure, already approved by the Senate and backed by Gov. Wolf, 
D  that would allow the drug to be administered to patients suffering 
D  from conditions including cancer, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
D  and epilepsy.
D  Still, supporters and detractors alike cautioned that many hurdles 
D  remained, including the potential for adding dozens of amendments, 
D  many of which were still being crafted Thursday and some of which 
D  could alter key portions of the legislation.
D  Lawmakers on both sides have been hopeful for months that the drug 
D  could be legalized for medicinal purposes before year’s end.
D  “There’s a sense that it’s time to do something on the issue,” 
D  said Mike Herzing, spokesman for House Democrats.
D  He and others said the question is how and whether the bill will 
D  be altered by the House and whether those changes, which could 
D  include caps on the drug’s potency levels, will affect its level 
D  of support from the Senate.
D  <NO1>if approved.<NO>“What we in the Senate are looking for is 
D  whether the bill is designed to get patients medicine,” said State 
D  Sen. Daylin Leach (D., Montgomery), a vocal supporter of medical 
D  marijuana, who was wary of <NO1>potential<NO>amendments. “We just 
D  want to make sure there’s no artificial limits.”
D  Already legal in 23 other states, <NO1>—<NO>including New Jersey, 
D  <NO1>—<NO>medical marijuana has been touted by supporters as an 
D  effective and safe treatment for symptoms of a variety of 
D  conditions.
D  While the <NO1>state<NO>Senate overwhelmingly passed a 
D  legalization bill this spring, the House established a bipartisan 
D  task force to study the issue.
D  The top-ranking Republican in the House, Speaker Mike Turzai (R., 
D  Allegheny), has voiced consistent opposition to medical 
D  legalization. His wife, a pediatrician, has supported it.
D  Majority Leader Dave Reed (R., Indiana) supports the measure and 
D  on Wednesday was one of 10 Republicans who voted to move the bill 
D  out of the Rules Committee, along with all 15 Democrats. Eight 
D  Republicans voted against it.
D  Passing the bill through that key committee should lead to a vote 
D  in the full chamber by next week, said Reed’s spokesman, Stephen 
D  Miskin.
D  While Leach welcomed any movement, he said that some potential 
D  provisions being discussed in the House, such as capping the 
D  potency of medicinal marijuana or limiting the parts of the plant 
D  to be used for certain conditions, could undercut the 
D  legislation’s effectiveness.
D  Chris Goldstein, a board member at PhillyNORML<NO1>cq<NO>, an 
D  advocacy group, and marijuana blogger at Philly.com, said diluting 
D  the Senate bill would be an unwelcome development for most 
D  supporters of medicinal marijuana.
D  “Basically, whatever they do, they’re going to further restrict 
D  the bill, and that’s not a good idea,” he said.
D  Disagreement between the House and Senate would force continued 
D  negotiations, thus delaying sending a bill to Wolf, a Democrat.
D  Goldstein said the losers would be patients who are suffering as 
D  the debate lingered.<NO1>on.<NO> With so many questions 
D  unanswered, he said, it was not clear when those in need of the 
D  drug might be able to receive it in Pennsylvania.
D  “It’s not helping any patients any time soon,” he said.

D  <DBblackbox> The Pennridge GreenJackets 155-pound football team is 
D  to host New Rochelle (N.Y.) in its third Pop Warner playoff game 
D  at noon Sunday at Central Bucks High School West. 
D  What may be even more notable is that coach Jason Moyer invited 
D  players from three other teams — Quakertown, Lenape Valley, and 
D  Abington — to play for Pennridge when those teams could not field 
D  a squad.
D  With a win Sunday and next week in the local finals, the 
D  GreenJackets (9-3) would advance to the national Pop Warner 
D  tournament in Orlando. [SIGNATURE]<TB>— Inquirer staff

D  <DBblackbox> [KERN-3]Montgomery County has proposed a tax increase 
D  of 9.8 percent for 2016, citing rising costs for debt service, 
D  inmate health care, an arbitration award with corrections 
D  officers, and increasing demands on county services.
D  The new tax rate would amount to roughly $199 per year for each 
D  $100,000 of property value. For the average homeowner, that would 
D  be $51.85 more than last year.
D  The budget proposed Thursday calls for $390 million in 
D  general-fund expenditures, a 5 percent increase over 2015. It also 
D  proposes $49.4 million in net capital expenses and $8.5 million in 
D  net open space spending.
D  Among other things, the tax increase would nearly double the 
D  county’s payment to its underfunded pension system, increase 
D  staffing for county parks and buildings, and provide a 1.5 percent 
D  raise for most employees.
D  Even with the increase, Montgomery County’s tax rate would remain 
D  lower than Bucks, Delaware, or Chester Counties’. 
D  Hearings on the proposed budget are scheduled for Dec. 3 at 11:30 
D  a.m. and 4 p.m. at One Montgomery Plaza, 450 Swede St., 
D  Norristown. The commissioners are scheduled to vote on the budget 
D  Dec. 17.
D  The proposal can be viewed online at www.montcopa.org<NO1>cq<NO> 
D  or in person on the eighth floor of One Montgomery Plaza. [/KERN-3]

D  </IP></CO><DBblackbox> The Brandywine Consignment Shop, which has 
D  donated nearly $1 million to community health and wellness 
D  programs over the last two decades, reopened Thursday after a 
D  six-month expansion project.
D  “The expanded space is increasing our bottom line and supporting 
D  affordable health care for the community,” Nancy Oliver, shop 
D  manager, said in a statement.
D  Donations go to the Brandywine Health Foundation to help support 
D  the Brandywine Center in Coatesville. The center provides more 
D  than 10,000 people each year with primary, dental, and prenatal 
D  care and behavioral health services.
D  The boards of the shop and Brandywine Health Foundation hope the 
D  expanded space and additional merchandise can double the roughly 
D  $50,000 the shop donates each year.
D  The shop at 368 W. Uwchlan Ave. in Downingtown is open Monday 
D  through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 
D  p.m. 
D  <NO1>It will host an open house on Dec. 6 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
D  Shoppers are encouraged to bring donations of peanut butter and 
D  canned fruit to support the Chester County Food Bank. The shop 
D  will accept food donations throughout the holiday season. <NO>

D  [/BYCREDIT]Two entertainment industry heavyweights have signed on 
D  to produce the Democratic National Convention.
D  Emmy-winning producer Ricky Kirshner and longtime creative 
D  producer Vicangelo Bulluck will plan and implement stage design, 
D  lighting, music, and entertainment at the Wells Fargo Center 
D  convention from July 25 to 28.
D  Organizers have said they will raise $84 million to cover the cost 
D  of the convention — nearly double the cost of the papal visit.
D  Kirshner is a nine-time Emmy winner who has worked on every 
D  Democratic convention since 1992<NO1>—including the last 
D  Democratic National Convention in Charlotte<NO>. He produced <NO1>
D  /<NO>President<NO1>/<NO> Obama’s inauguration<NO1>/<NO>s<NO1>/<NO>
D  , every Tony Awards ceremony since 1993, and every Super Bowl 
D  halftime show since 2007, including last year’s featuring Bruno 
D  Mars, which was the most viewed in history.
D  “It is a great honor to once again be a part of the DNCC 
D  Production Team,” Kirshner said in a statement. “We look forward 
D  to bringing to the world the message of the party and our nominee 
D  in many new, fresh, and exciting ways.”
D  For 10 years, Bulluck produced the NAACP Image Awards, which have 
D  paid tribute to Sidney Poitier, Oprah Winfrey, Bono, and 
D  then-Sen<NO1>ator<NO>. <NO1>Barack <NO>Obama.
D  He was the managing director of outreach and special events for 
D  the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, where he 
D  implemented its diversity and international initiatives, and 
D  managed the production of several awards shows. Bulluck also 
D  opened the Hollywood<NO1> Bureau<NO> office of the national NAACP 
D  and was its first executive director. 
D  “This will be the most digitally integrated convention in history, 
D  with a reach far beyond the walls of the convention hall,” Bulluck 
D  said in a statement.

D  [/BYCREDIT]For a month beginning this weekend, Dilworth Park will 
D  spotlight local artists and their unique creations in a new 
D  holiday-theme festival and market.
D  The Made in Philadelphia Holiday Market at Dilworth Park will have 
D  30 vendors, including purveyors of hand-popped kettle corn and 
D  “potato tornados,” artisan woodcrafters, and makers of 
D  eco-friendly neck warmers. It will open Saturday and stay until 
D  Dec. 27. It will be closed Christmas.
D  While it is there, the park will be filled with decorated tents 
D  stocked with arts and crafts, jewelry, accessories, and food and 
D  drink booths, all from the Philadelphia area.
D  That is in contrast with Christmas Village in Philadelphia, which 
D  offers traditional European food, sweets, and drinks, and features 
D  international holiday gifts, ornaments, jewelry, and arts and 
D  crafts.
D  Made in Philadelphia was conceived and designed to complement 
D  Christmas Village, now in its eighth year. The village will open 
D  this weekend at nearby LOVE Park, close for a few days, and reopen 
D  on Thanksgiving. It then will stay in business through Dec. 27. 
D  Hours for both markets are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday through 
D  Thursday and 11 a.m. until 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday. 
D  Both festivals were created by German American Marketing.
D  By the way, potato tornados are fried, spiral-cut potato slices 
D  served on a stick.

D  [/BYCREDIT]Two former state lawmakers from Philadelphia, forced 
D  out of office after a corruption sting investigation, have agreed 
D  to pay fines and costs for violating ethics laws, officials said 
D  Thursday.
D  Democrats Michelle F. Brownlee and Ronald G. Waters pleaded guilty 
D  this year to corruption charges in the sting case that had been 
D  dropped by Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen G. Kane and 
D  resurrected by Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams.
D  The State Ethics Commission said that it reached a consent 
D  agreement with Brownlee and Waters, and that if they complied with 
D  the terms, the agency would close their cases.
D  Brownlee, who represented the 195th House District, agreed to pay 
D  a $250 fine for failing to disclose a $2,000 cash payment made to 
D  her by sting informant Tyron B. Ali.
D  She also agreed to pay $250 to the commission for expenses and 
D  costs of its investigation, and $2,000 concurrent restitution to 
D  Dauphin County Court.
D  Brownlee received the cash — wrapped in a napkin — from Ali during 
D  a walk outside a Harrisburg restaurant.
D  [KERN-3]Waters, who represented the 191st District, agreed to pay 
D  a $1,000 fine for failing to disclose payments from Ali made to 
D  him, and $250 for expenses and costs of the commission’s 
D  investigation.
D  [/KERN-3]He also agreed to pay concurrent restitution of $8,750 to 
D  Dauphin County Court. That was the amount of cash Waters accepted 
D  from Ali.
D  After one of the payments, Waters was caught on tape saying, 
D  “Happy birthday to Ron Waters.”
D  Dauphin County Court had already ordered Brownlee and Waters to 
D  pay their restitution amounts, so they will not pay twice.
D  Brownlee was sentenced to 18 months on probation. Waters was 
D  sentenced to 23 months. Both resigned their seats after they were 
D  sentenced.

D  [/BYCREDIT]The lawyer for <NO1>North Philadelphia <NO>demolition 
D  contractor Griffin Campbell said Thursday that he would oppose a 
D  move to question Campbell under oath ahead of next year’s trial in 
D  a suit filed on behalf of the victims in the deadly 2013 collapse 
D  of a Salvation Army building in Center City.
D  Lawyers seeking damages for the six killed and 13 injured in the 
D  June 5, 2013, disaster at 22d and Market Streets want to depose 
D  Campbell under oath for five days in January.
D  Campbell testified in his defense in the criminal trial last 
D  month, in which he was found guilty of six counts of involuntary 
D  manslaughter and other charges.
D  But defense attorney William D. Hobson said questioning in a civil 
D  deposition could be far more wide-ranging than the questions put 
D  to Campbell at trial, and could violate his Fifth Amendment right 
D  against self-incrimination.
D  “My position is very simple,” Hobson said. “He has exercised his 
D  right to file an appeal. Simply because he testified at trial does 
D  not mean I’m going to let him be questioned in a deposition.”
D  Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Mark I. Bernstein<NO1>CQ 
D  ALL<NO>, who oversees pretrial matters in the civil case, has set 
D  a Nov. 30 hearing date on plaintiffs’ lawyers request to depose 
D  Campbell and Sean Benschop<NO1>CQ BOTH<NO>, operator of the 
D  excavator that toppled a freestanding three-story wall that 
D  crushed the adjacent thrift store.
D  Robert J. Mongeluzzi<NO1>CQ<NO>, who filed the petition to 
D  question Campbell and Benschop, could not immediately be reached 
D  for comment Thursday.
D  Benschop’s criminal attorney, William Davis, said he was not 
D  involved with the civil case and declined comment. Davis said he 
D  had not spoken with Benschop recently and did not know whether he 
D  knew of the deposition petition.
D  Both Campbell, 51, and Benschop, 44, who pleaded guilty to charges 
D  and testified for the prosecution during Campbell’s trial, are to 
D  be sentenced Jan. 8 by Common Pleas Court Judge Glenn B. 
D  Bronson<NO1>CQ ALL<NO>.
D  Mongeluzzi’s petition proposes that Campbell’s deposition begin 
D  Jan. 11 and last five days, followed by five days of questioning 
D  Benschop, starting Jan. 18.
D  The civil trial consolidates 20 individual lawsuits. Those sued 
D  include Campbell and Benschop, and also 16 other individuals and 
D  entities with much deeper pockets: Richard Basciano<NO1>CQ<NO>, 
D  the real estate developer who owned the building at 2136-38 Market 
D  St. that collapsed and crushed the store; national and local 
D  entities of the Salvation Army; and Plato A. Marinakos Jr.<NO1>CQ 
D  ALL<NO>, Basciano’s demolition architect, who testified before a 
D  county grand jury under a grant of immunity and against Campbell 
D  at trial.
D  Last month, plaintiffs’ lawyer Steven G. Wigrizer said lawyers had 
D  deposed about 30 witnesses but still had 50 to 80 to do, including 
D  Basciano and his project manager, Thomas Simmonds<NO1>CQ<NO>, and 
D  Richard Cresci<NO1>CQ<NO>, an officer of Basciano’s company.
D  Bernstein has set May 2 <NO1>2016<NO>for a final settlement 
D  conference to see whether there is any possibility of avoiding 
D  what he predicted would be a four-week trial starting Sept. 6.

D  <NO>[/WEBTAGS]A group of alumni-elected trustees at Pennsylvania 
D  State University will get to review documents used by an outside 
D  investigator who found university leaders culpable of a cover-up 
D  in the Jerry Sandusky child-sex-abuse scandal.
D  The university must turn over to the seven trustees within 20 days 
D  all material not privileged or confidential and within 45 days all 
D  material that is privileged or confidential, according to a 
D  decision by Centre County Court. The documents were prepared by 
D  former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who led the 
D  university-commissioned investigation.
D  Alumni trustees have argued for years that Freeh unfairly blamed 
D  the university and accused former administrators of covering up 
D  abuse by Sandusky, a former assistant football coach, now in 
D  prison. They want to see Freeh’s interview documents and other 
D  material to understand how he reached his conclusions in July 
D  2012.
D  Under the court order, trustees can discuss the “confidential” or 
D  “privileged” material only in a private executive session of the 
D  nearly 40-member board or with the university’s legal counsel.
D  Given the required confidentiality, it is unclear what effect the 
D  release of the documents will have on the narrative of the scandal 
D  that has gripped the university since Sandusky was arrested in 
D  November 2011.[SIGNATURE]<QM> — Susan Snyder[/SIGNATURE]

D  [/BYCREDIT]<NO1>photo/3/27/1912/<NO>Robert Hopkins Foell<NO1>cq<NO>
D  , 103, of North Hills, a quality control inspector for a steel 
D  company, died Thursday, Nov. 12, of congestive heart failure.
D  Mr. Foell died at home after a lengthy decline. On his last night, 
D  he slept while his family watched [ITALIC]Jeopardy![/ITALIC]
D  “It was one of his favorite shows. And until just a few weeks 
D  before he died, he knew most of the answers,” his family said in a 
D  tribute.
D  Mr. Foell was born in 1912, two weeks before the Titanic sank in 
D  the North Atlantic on its maiden voyage and two years before the 
D  outbreak of World War I.
D  Tales of Mr. Foell’s long life fascinated his family. “It was 
D  quite a ride,” said daughter Lois Jean Odabas<NO1>cq<NO>. 
D  As a child, he remembered the funeral of his much older brother, 
D  Harry, who was killed in combat in World War I. He described the 
D  military funeral cortege moving northward on Broad Street en route 
D  to burial.
D  Another memory was of men pushing heavy carts along the streets of 
D  Philadelphia during the influenza epidemic of 1918. The men called 
D  out, “Bring out your dead,” and then transported the victims to a 
D  cemetery.
D  He was a life-long member of the Baptist Temple, where he was 
D  dedicated<NO1>not baptized<NO> as an infant by <NO1>Dr.<NO>Russell 
D  H. Conwell<NO1>cq<NO>, founder of Temple University. The Baptist 
D  Temple is now a performing arts center at Temple.
D  His knowledge of church history was so deep that the architects of 
D  a building renovation invited him to visit the site and have lunch 
D  with them when he was 97, his family said.
D  Fascinated with electronics and technology, Mr. Foell, pronounced 
D  [ITALIC]Fell[/ITALIC], was employed by Proctor<NO1>cq<NO> Electric 
D  Co. before and during World War II. He worked 16-hour days 
D  inspecting the mechanism for ejection seats destined for 
D  airplanes.
D  In 1955, he went to work at <NO1>cq<NO>Standard Pressed Steel in 
D  Jenkintown, where he worked as a quality control inspector for 
D  parts used in the Apollo moon mission.
D  [KERN-2]He was particularly proud of the exploding bolts that 
D  separated the booster rocket from the space capsule at the edge of 
D  the atmosphere. None of his other bolts, the ones meant to remain 
D  in place, ever failed, his family said. “We know that because the 
D  astronauts came back,” his daughter said. He retired in 1977 at 
D  65.
D  [/KERN-2]In retirement, he assisted in the office at Grace Baptist 
D  Church in Blue Bell until he was 101, driving himself to work 
D  every day.
D  He was a Boy Scout and Boy Scout leader for Troop 33, Edge 
D  Hill<NO1>cq<NO>, for <NO1>over<NO>more than 50 years.
D  <NO1>“He imparted his love of camping and hiking to generations of 
D  his own family and to the Boy Scouts he led,” his relatives said. 
D  
D  <NO>He married Emily Wilkinson. The two were together until her 
D  death in 1998 at age 84.
D  [KERN+2]As far as the younger generations went, he had no patience 
D  with lengthy courtships. When Morgan Dawirs<NO1>cq<NO>, the woman 
D  who would become his granddaughter-in-law, sat down to dinner one 
D  Thanksgiving, he leaned over and said, “You'd make a lovely 
D  addition to our family.”
D  [/KERN+2]“She blushed,” his daughter said. “She was waiting for my 
D  son, Zachary, <NO1>\[Shalla\] <NO>to ask her.”
D  When the wedding did occur, Mr. Foell, then 101, flew to Seattle 
D  to participate.
D  Besides his daughter and grandson, Mr. Foell is survived by 
D  daughters Emily Frances Crist<NO1>cq<NO> and Nancy Carol 
D  Kraynak<NO1>cq<NO>; son Robert Daniel<NO1>cq<NO>; 11 other 
D  grandchildren; and 22 great-grandchildren.
D  A memorial service is to be at 4 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 21, at the 
D  Grace Baptist Church of Blue Bell, 437 Skippack Pike, Blue Bell, 
D  Pa. 19422<NO1>cq<NO>. Burial is private.
D  Donations may be made to the church at the address above.

D  [/BYCREDIT]As outdoors columnist for The Inquirer, Ben 
D  Callaway,<NO1>(CQ ALL)<NO> a stickler for accuracy, cast a hard 
D  eye on depictions he felt were inauthentic — even in a movie.
D  Writing about the opening of bear-hunting season in Pennsylvania 
D  in a 1989 column, he took aim at a recently released movie, 
D  [ITALIC]The Bear[/ITALIC]. He wrote: “The photography is superb, 
D  the scenery is lovely, and the cub in this entertaining story is 
D  cuddly cute. But a documentary it ain’t.”
D  He hoped “viewers don’t substitute this make-believe stuff for 
D  factual wildlife biology. Let’s not support a sudden adopt-a-pet 
D  hysteria for dangerous wild animals. You don’t housebreak bears, 
D  most certainly not grizzlies.”
D  On Sunday, Nov. 15, Ben Anderson Callaway, 88<NO1>(DOB 3/16/27)<NO>
D  , of Southampton, the Philadelphia Daily News’ sports editor in 
D  the 1960s and The Inquirer’s outdoor-sports columnist in the 
D  1980s, died of congestive heart failure at Virtua Voorhees 
D  hospital.
D  When she was in elementary school, his daughter Karen Franks<NO1>
D  (CQ BOTH)<NO> recalled, he would take her on fishing trips off the 
D  Jersey Shore.
D  “I was the only one in the family who didn’t get seasick. I loved 
D  it,” Franks said.
D  “We did blue fishing, sometimes all night,” she said, to get 
D  enough material for the next column.
D  “He would circulate around” with the other fishers, and “go up to 
D  talk to the captain. A real people person.”
D  As a columnist, he seldom came into the newsroom, so one of the 
D  few who regularly spoke with him was former sports desk manager 
D  Maureen Meehan<NO1>(CQ BOTH)<NO>.
D  “He was a sweetheart of a guy,” Meehan said. “Very kind and 
D  gentle.”
D  Sam Carchidi<NO1>(CQ BOTH)<NO>, who now covers the Flyers for The 
D  Inquirer, was covering high school sports for the paper when he 
D  first met Mr. Callaway in the office in the 1980s.
D  “He was a great guy,” Carchidi said. “He took younger people under 
D  his wing, always had time for you.”
D  Carchidi recalled that “he was a very gracious man, had an air 
D  about him, the kind of guy everybody respected.”
D  Born in Oakland, Calif., Mr. Callaway graduated from New Trier 
D  (Ill.) High School, where he was a member of the varsity 
D  basketball team. He enlisted in the Navy in 1944, when he was 17, 
D  and served stateside for 18 months as a personnel clerk.
D  After studying at Stanford University, Mr. Callaway earned a 
D  bachelor’s [BOLD][/BOLD]degree at Denison University in Granville, 
D  Ohio, where he was on the varsity tennis team.
D  <NO1>(HTTP://DENISON.EDU)
D  <NO>In autobiographical notes, Mr. Callaway wrote that he worked 
D  at the Denver Post from 1949, and became president of the Denver 
D  Sports Writers and Broadcasters Association.
D  He was on the sports staff at the Daily News from 1957 to 1980 — 
D  as sports editor from 1961 to 1970 — and was on the sports staff 
D  of The Inquirer from 1980 to 1989.
D  Though “he did go out to games” as an Inquirer sports reporter, 
D  his daughter said, he soon became a columnist.
D  “His goal was to become the outdoors columnist,” she said, “so he 
D  could mix business with pleasure.”
D  He also did fishing commentaries for KYW NewsRadio from 1971 to 
D  1995.
D  Mike DeNardo<NO1>(CQ BOTH)<NO>, a reporter and editor there, 
D  recalled that “he would call in his reports, I believe from home.”
D  
D  [KERN+2]“Ben was one of the kindest, gentlest professionals I ever 
D  had the pleasure of working with,” DeNardo said, both at KYW Radio 
D  and at the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association.
D  [/KERN+2]“He was a stickler for the truth,” he said, “and had a 
D  passion for what he did.”
D  [KERN+2]Mr. Callaway’s autobiographical notes state that for a 
D  time, he was president of the Philadelphia Sports Writers 
D  Association and the New Jersey Outdoor Writers Association. And 
D  for a time<NO1>, he wrote,<NO>, he was a director of the Outdoor 
D  Writers Association of America and the Mason-Dixon Outdoor Writers 
D  Association. 
D  [/KERN+2]In retirement, Mr. Callaway contributed sports reports to 
D  The Inquirer and the Camden Courier-Post.
D  At Trinity Presbyterian Church in Cherry Hill, Mr. Callaway 
D  cofounded the Daytime Men’s Group in 1985 and was its coordinator 
D  until 10 years ago.
D  Edward Mitchell<NO1>(CQ BOTH)<NO>, who has led the monthly 
D  meetings since then, said, “He set up all the programs and got the 
D  guest speakers to come in” to offer religious comments on the 
D  concerns of the day.
D  “He was a neat guy,” Mitchell said. “A great sense of humor, very 
D  dry sense of humor.”
D  Besides his daughter, Mr. Callaway is survived by son Randall, a 
D  sister, and two grandsons. His wife of 56 years, Patricia, died in 
D  2006.<NO1>(CQ ALL SPELLINGS)<NO>
D  A memorial service was set for 2 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 22, at Trinity 
D  Presbyterian Church, 499 Route 70 E., Cherry Hill, with inurnment 
D  in The Dalles, Ore.

D  </MC>[/SUBHED_OBIT][KERN-0]P.F. Sloan, 70, the troubled 
D  singer-songwriter behind such classic 1960s tunes as Johnny 
D  Rivers’ “Secret Agent Man” and Barry McGuire’s “Eve of 
D  Destruction,” died Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. [/KERN-0]
D  Howard Wuelfing, a spokesman, said Mr. Sloan had been battling 
D  pancreatic cancer for several weeks.
D  [KERN-2]Born Philip Gary Schlein in New York City, Mr. Sloan 
D  signed his first record deal when he was 13 and went on to write 
D  songs for such artists as the Turtles, the Grass Roots, and the 
D  5th Dimension. He also released several of his own albums and 
D  published the memoir [ITALIC]What’s Exactly The Matter With 
D  Me?[/ITALIC] last year. 
D  [/KERN-2][KERN-0]His biggest hit was “Eve of Destruction,” which 
D  he wrote in a single day in 1964 when he was in his teens<NO1> and 
D  living at home<NO>.<NO1> The apocalyptic protest anthem came out 
D  in 1965, as opposition grew against the Vietnam War, and caused a 
D  sensation. The song topped the charts in August, although its 
D  lyrics infuriated conservatives. 
D  Supporters of lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, what in 1971 
D  became the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, embraced the 
D  song’s cry that “You’re old enough to kill, but not for voting.” 
D  <NO> Mr. Sloan was traumatized by his sudden fame<NO1> and would 
D  allege that the song led to his being ostracized from the music 
D  industry<NO>. He battled depression and dropped out from public 
D  life for years. He began recording and performing again in recent 
D  years. [SIGNATURE]<QM>— AP

D  home in New York City. The cause was lung cancer, said his

D  [KERN-3]Mr. Birmingham began his literary career as a novelist,

D  [/SUBHED_OBIT]Henry S. Rowen, 90, an American policymaker and 
D  Stanford University economist who was president of the RAND Corp. 
D  when it helped produce the Pentagon Papers, has died, university 
D  officials announced Thursday. 
D  [KERN-3]Tom Gilligan, the director of the Hoover Institution, 
D  confirmed his death. Mr. Rowen collapsed at the university on his 
D  way to an event on Nov. 12. A cause of death has not been 
D  released.
D  [/KERN-3]A leading scholar on economic growth in the U.S. and Asia 
D  and a national security expert, Mr. Rowen started his career as an 
D  economist at the RAND think tank and later became a senior fellow 
D  at the Hoover Institution.
D  [KERN-3]He took the helm at RAND Corp. in 1967. That same year, 
D  Defense Secretary Robert McNamara launched a top-secret study of 
D  U.S. policies in Vietnam that became known as the Pentagon Papers. 
D  It involved Defense Department and private analysts, including 
D  from RAND. 
D  [/KERN-3]Among the RAND analysts was Daniel Ellsberg, who secretly 
D  photocopied the project’s documents and released them to the New 
D  York Times, which published the first in its series of stories 
D  about the findings on June 13, 1971. 
D  When Ellsberg was arrested on charges of conspiracy, espionage, 
D  and theft of government property, Mr. Rowen knew that RAND’s 
D  reputation was in jeopardy, and he resigned. 
D  To this day, Ellsberg says he regrets how his actions affected Mr. 
D  Rowen. “He was the closest friend I ever had,” Ellsberg said in an 
D  interview with the Los Angeles Times this week. “I loved him like 
D  a brother.”
D  Mr. Rowen is survived by his wife, Beverly Griffiths; six 
D  children; and nine grandchildren. [SIGNATURE]<QM>— AP[/SIGNATURE]

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Sixers tank job: The generational divide 
D  [/WEBHEAD][BYLINE]By Mike Sielski 
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER COLUMNIST 
D  [/BYCREDIT]<NO>Let’s begin with what this column is not.
D  <CW-10>This column is not an attempt to re-litigate the wisdom or 
D  integrity of the 76ers’ rebuilding plan. For one thing, the sides 
D  have already been chosen in that debate, and they are intractable. 
D  The conversation is redundant and tiresome. For another, given the 
D  Sixers’ play this season and, in particular, their performance 
D  Wednesday night in their 112-85 loss to the Indiana Pacers, it’s 
D  natural to ask,[ITALIC] Weren’t things supposed to be better by 
D  now?[/ITALIC]
D  </CW>The Sixers are 0-12. They have lost 22 straight games dating 
D  to last season. They committed 31 turnovers Wednesday against the 
D  Pacers, the most turnovers by an NBA team in 15 years — after 
D  committing 27 in their previous game. Their head coach, Brett 
D  Brown, appears so sapped of energy and hope that his postgame news 
D  conferences have become a form of sadomasochistic performance art, 
D  as if he were a character in a Mamet play that you know will end 
D  terribly.
D  [KERN-3]This is the here and now of the Sixers, and it is ugly, 
D  and no one can deny it. This is also where public opinion about 
D  the franchise’s future bifurcates. There are those who believe 
D  that the Sixers’ course of action — paying little attention to 
D  wins and losses, hoarding draft picks to try to get themselves a 
D  superstar or superstars, maintaining roster flexibility by 
D  refusing (or being unable) to sign veteran players to long-term 
D  contracts — is a sucker’s play. And there are those — and I count 
D  myself among them — who have argued that the plan [ITALIC]
D  could[/ITALIC] work in a way that the franchise’s previous efforts 
D  to win a championship never would.
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-2]Again, that divide is an old story by now. What’s 
D  interesting about it, though, is that it seems to break down 
D  cleanly along a generational line. That is, broadly speaking and 
D  boiled down to its simplest, catchiest essence, older people don’t 
D  get what the Sixers are doing, and younger people do.
D  [/KERN-2][KERN-3]OK, now the parameters and disclaimers. In using 
D  the terms “older” and “younger,” I’m setting the age of 40 as my 
D  Line of Demarcation. That doesn’t mean that every Baby Boomer or 
D  Gen Xer wants to roast Sam Hinkie on a spit, or that there aren’t 
D  Millennials whose souls bleed every time the Sixers lose a game 
D  and who wish the team had taken a different tack. It does mean — 
D  based on such anecdotal evidence as the opinions expressed by 
D  traditional media members, bloggers, talk-show hosts, and fans — 
D  that people over 40, people who are supposed to see the bigger and 
D  broader picture and be more experienced and rational in their 
D  perspectives, tend to dislike the plan. And that people under 40, 
D  people who are supposed to be full of emotion and conviction and 
D  passionate intensity, tend to be more supportive of the plan, or 
D  at least more patient in evaluating it.
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-2]Why the counterintuitive nature of this split? 
D  Here’s a theory:
D  [/KERN-2][KERN-3]If you grew up as a basketball fan in the 1960s, 
D  the 1970s, and even the mid-1980s, you’re likely to remember the 
D  Sixers as a proud, prosperous franchise with a history of great 
D  players: Wilt Chamberlain, Billy Cunningham, Hal Greer, Julius 
D  Erving, Mo Cheeks, Doug Collins, Moses Malone, Charles Barkley. 
D  Those are precious memories, and the Sixers’ approach these days — 
D  purposely putting an overmatched team on the court for the sake of 
D  starting fresh — besmirches those memories and that tradition.
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-3]But if you grew up as a basketball fan in the 
D  1990s and 2000s, you’re likely to remember the Sixers having a 
D  long tradition as bottom-feeders. From 1991 through 1998, they 
D  averaged 26 victories a season, and their drafts were the stuff of 
D  standup routines: Clarence Weatherspoon, Sharone Wright, Shawn 
D  Bradley, B.J. Tyler, Larry Hughes over Paul Pierce, cue the laugh 
D  track. Then, after a modest five-year uptick when Allen Iverson 
D  was in his prime, they went through an 11-year stretch in which 
D  they had two winning seasons, won one playoff series, and were bad 
D  enough to secure a top-five draft pick just once. And with that 
D  pick, they drafted Evan Turner. You think these Sixers are 
D  hopeless? You haven’t known hopelessness until you’ve seen Bradley 
D  try to body Shaquille O’Neal in the post.
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-3]That fallow period informs the younger generation 
D  just as the franchise’s glory days inform the elder one, and in 
D  comparison to the haphazard incompetence of Brad Greenberg and 
D  Eddie Jordan, the cold logic and possible windfall of Hinkie’s 
D  plan have great appeal. More, this younger generation of sports 
D  fans/followers has been conditioned to evaluate teams vis-a-vis 
D  salary caps and the goal of sustaining success over time — a 
D  calculation that, in previous eras, no one had to take into 
D  account. In 1976, eight years before the NBA implemented its cap, 
D  the Sixers could buy Erving’s contract from the ABA’s New York 
D  Nets for whatever sum was necessary ($6 million, as it turned 
D  out). The move was seen, rightly, as a sign that they expected to 
D  contend. In 2005, the Sixers signed Samuel Dalembert to a 
D  six-year, $64 million extension. In a salary-cap world, the move 
D  was seen, rightly, as a sign that they had no idea what they were 
D  doing.
D  [/KERN-3]Do they know what they’re doing now? Put it this way: 
D  Your answer to that question probably depends on your answer to 
D  another. Who was your favorite Sixers player when you were a kid: 
D  Andrew Toney or Andrew Lang?

D  <NO>[/WEBHEAD]<NO1>[WEBTAGS]nits
D  [/WEBTAGS][BYLINE]By Joe Juliano
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]<NO><CP12><CL15>[DROPBLUE4]P<MC>enn State’s Christian 
D  Hackenberg can do some amazing things with his arm and a football 
D  — such as the 17-yard throw on a line that he made to tight end 
D  Kyle Carter at the far hash against Maryland — that make you say, 
D  “Wow!”
D  [/DROPBLUE4]</CL></CP>“There aren’t that many quarterbacks on the 
D  planet that could have completed that pass,” NFL Network analyst 
D  Mike Mayock said last week. “It was a big-arm throw into a tight 
D  window. I watched it back about five times.”
D  But there are other throws that leave Mayock and NFL scouts and 
D  observers scratching their heads, such as short patterns and 
D  bubble screens on which the ball one-hops to the receiver or sails 
D  over his head. Hackenberg has issues with accuracy and consistency 
D  that are hindered by occasionally spotty pass protection as well.
D  <NO1>After a bye last week, <NO>The 6-foot-4, 228-pound Hackenberg 
D  has two more regular-season contests — Saturday against Michigan 
D  and next week at Michigan State — and a bowl game remaining in his 
D  junior season <NO1>at quarterback <NO>for the Nittany Lions. He 
D  then will make a crucial decision about his future — either come 
D  out for the NFL draft or return to Penn State for his senior year.
D  
D  There are two schools of thought as to what he should do. One says 
D  the offensive system of head coach James Franklin does not quite 
D  fit his talents and that he’d be better off learning the NFL game. 
D  The other says his slow warming to the system and good skill 
D  players around him put him in good shape for a senior season 
D  during which he can become a solid first-round pick.
D  As for right now, most NFL mock drafts have Hackenberg as a 
D  second-round pick, with three quarterbacks — California’s Jared 
D  Goff, Michigan State’s Connor Cook, and Memphis’ Paxton Lynch — 
D  ranked ahead of him.
D  Opinions of Hackenberg this season have been mixed.
D  “He has the big arm and the size,” said a senior NFL personnel 
D  director who asked not to be identified, “so I could see someone 
D  taking a chance on him in the first round if he comes out. But I’m 
D  not sure the film backs it up.”
D  Another observer, NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah, said in an 
D  online story that Hackenberg’s “accuracy, touch, and awareness are 
D  all question marks.” He concluded by saying, “On the whole, 
D  there’s more to be concerned about than excited about with him.”
D  Scouts and officials from seven NFL teams, including Chicago Bears 
D  general manager Ryan Pace, watched Hackenberg in person during 
D  Penn State’s 23-21 loss at Northwestern on Nov.<TH>7. Hackenberg 
D  hit just one of his first 10 passes and finished 21 of 40 for 205 
D  yards, one interception, and no touchdowns.
D  After the game, Hackenberg politely brushed off a question about 
D  being watched by NFL people.
D  “I just worry about doing what my teammates expect of me,” he 
D  said, “and what I need to do here at Penn State right now to be 
D  the best football player I can be for this football team. Whatever 
D  they ask me to do, that’s what I’m going to try to do to the best 
D  of my ability.”
D  For the season, Hackenberg has completed 54.2 percent of his 
D  passes for 1,992 yards, 13 touchdowns, and three interceptions. He 
D  went six full games and 201 passes without an interception before 
D  the Northwestern game.
D  “Here’s the thing when you look at Christian when you’re scouting 
D  him,” Big Ten Network analyst and former Penn State all-American 
D  Matt Millen said. “You ask, ‘Does he possess the necessary arm 
D  strength?’ Yes. ‘Can he be accurate?’ Yes. ‘But can he be 
D  inaccurate?’ Yes. Then it gets back to mechanics. It goes down to 
D  getting your feet properly set.
D  “He can make all the throws. He’s a smart kid. He can play the 
D  game at the line of scrimmage. He understands defenses. 
D  Mechanically sometimes he’s unsound. Sometimes after he gets a 
D  little bit of pressure, he starts to feel it. But if I’m sitting 
D  in that seat to analyze, does he have the necessary skills to step 
D  forward, and the answer is still yes. Before you’d say, ‘This is a 
D  top-five pick.’ Now you say, ‘Is he still a top-five pick?’ He 
D  needs work.
D  “So do you come back, or do you take your chances and just come 
D  out? I don’t know what the answer is for him.”
D  Mayock evaluates the draft for NFL Network, and<NO1> which 
D  means<NO> he watches every play of a prospect. He said he would do 
D  that for Hackenberg if the quarterback comes out for the draft. In 
D  the meantime, he has studied only Penn State’s 31-30 win over 
D  Maryland on Oct.<TH>24, when Hackenberg<NO1> in which the 
D  quarterback<NO> completed only 13 of 29 passes but for a 
D  season-high 315 yards.
D  “I can tell you point-blank that there’s an NFL skill-set there as 
D  far as size, arm strength, athletic ability, foot talent,” he 
D  said. “I can see all of that on tape. I saw him at the Manning 
D  Passing Academy this summer. That’s a big strong kid that can 
D  throw a pretty football. All the physical capabilities are there.”
D  
D  While Mayock saw some good throws against Maryland, he also saw 
D  accuracy issues.
D  “He hit some throws that make you want to believe he can make any 
D  throw,” he said. “But then he leaves four or five open deep routes 
D  either short or on the wrong side. So I guess what I’m getting at 
D  is, his physical tool set is imposing, but his lack of consistency 
D  is worrisome.”
D  Another scouting issue is the fact that Hackenberg is a third-year 
D  junior, and Mayock said he’s never seen a third-year junior at any 
D  postseason all-star games, where NFL teams evaluate prospects. 
D  That would leave just private workouts for teams to study him.
D  Hackenberg hasn’t given any clue if he will return for his senior 
D  season, or if Saturday’s game against No.<TH>14 Michigan will be 
D  his last game in Beaver Stadium. He was asked Tuesday if he has 
D  given any consideration to possibly playing for the last time in 
D  Happy Valley.
D  “Not really,” he replied. “I’m just focusing on it one week at a 
D  time, doing what I need to do to make sure I’m the most prepared I 
D  can be. … It’s a great challenge that we have this week against 
D  Michigan. They bring a lot of stuff to the table. So we’re really 
D  excited about that, and I think that’s where all our heads are 
D  right now.”
D  Hackenberg has shown progress from his sophomore to his junior 
D  year. After throwing 15 interceptions last season, he has been 
D  much better at not forcing throws into tight coverage. During his 
D  six-game run without an interception, he threw 12 touchdown 
D  passes, ran for two scores, and caught a TD pass.
D  “I didn’t like what I saw last year,” an NFL scout said. “I was 
D  expecting more. He stared at the rush and was indecisive as a 
D  decision-maker. He turned the ball over too much. But he’s gotten 
D  better in all three phases this season. He’s not especially 
D  accurate, but he isn’t forcing passes as much.”
D  There also is a question of whether all the hits Hackenberg has 
D  taken in the last two seasons — 44 sacks last year, 32 thus far 
D  this year — have affected his willingness to hang in the pocket 
D  against the rush. Other than sitting out during mop-up time 
D  against Illinois, he has missed just one snap all season.
D  “When a quarterback starts worrying about the rush, that’s a 
D  problem,” Big Ten analyst and former head coach Gerry DiNardo 
D  said. “It’s human nature. It happens to everybody. Some respond by 
D  scrambling, others respond by throwing off their back foot. I 
D  think all quarterbacks are impacted by the amount of rush they 
D  get.”
D  DiNardo said Hackenberg has benefited from being in the same 
D  system for a second season, and that he has “really grown up with 
D  his emotions on the field” including his maturity and his 
D  leadership.
D  Perhaps the high-profile games against Michigan and Michigan State 
D  <NO1>to end the regular season <NO>will influence what Hackenberg 
D  decides. Maybe a repeat of his performance in the Pinstripe Bowl — 
D  34 for 50, 371 yards, four touchdowns — will have him leaning in a 
D  specific direction.
D  Whatever the case, Nittany Nation will be on the edge of its 
D  collective seat over what he will do. So probably will NFL 
D  personnel people and observers.
D  “This really is an intriguing kid,” Mayock said.

D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Sam Carchidi
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]The Flyers’ much-maligned defense played one of its 
D  strongest games of the season Thursday, not allowing San Jose much 
D  offensive-zone time after the first period.
D  But it wasn’t enough because the Flyers’ offense came up short. 
D  Again.
D  Melker Karlsson scored on a two-on-one with 1 minute, 15 seconds 
D  left in overtime as the Sharks outlasted the Flyers, 1-0, at the 
D  Wells Fargo Center.
D  The Sharks had a four-on-three at the start of overtime because of 
D  a Wayne Simmonds tripping penalty with 18.9 seconds left in a 
D  scoreless regulation.
D  Thanks to Steve Mason’s stop on Patrick Marleau (999 career 
D  points) in front, the Flyers killed off the penalty.
D  The Flyers had a 34-21 shots advantage — and a 29-11 domination 
D  after the first period.
D  The Sharks recorded their ninth straight win at the Wells Fargo 
D  Center since 2000. Overall, the Flyers have just one win in their 
D  last 18 meetings (1-10-7) against San Jose. 
D  The Flyers entered the game with a league-low 15 goals in nine 
D  home games, and they had just seven even-strength goals in that 
D  span.
D  The teams took turns controlling the first two periods.
D  The Flyers had more chances in the second period — they outshot 
D  the Sharks, 15-5 — but goalie Martin Jones had all the answers. He 
D  made key stops on Simmonds and Jake Voracek to keep the game 
D  scoreless.
D  Pierre-Edouard Bellemare also had a quality second-period 
D  opportunity as he outraced the defense, skated through the right 
D  circle and fired wide of the left post.
D  Sean Couturier and his linemates did a commendable job on Joe 
D  Thornton’s line. That contributed to the Sharks going nearly 13 
D  minutes between shots in the second period — and getting just two 
D  shots in about a 25-minute span in the second and third periods.
D  San Jose had a territorial advantage, a 15-4 faceoff domination, 
D  and a 10-6 shots edge in the opening period, one in which Mason 
D  made his best save on a point-blank backhander by Justin Braun 
D  early in the session.
D  Michael Raffl, sent in on a breakaway by defenseman Shayne 
D  Gostisbehere, had the Flyers’ best first-period scoring chance, 
D  but he fired his shot right at Jones.
D  The Sharks won the first three games of their six-game trip, 
D  beating Detroit, Buffalo, and Boston. Their trek continues in 
D  Pittsburgh and Columbus.
D  The Flyers were coming off a 3-2 shootout loss to Los Angeles, and 
D  they were trying to increase their points streak to a modest three 
D  games. They play in Ottawa on Saturday night before hosting 
D  Carolina on Monday, when Hurricanes assistant Rod Brind’Amour will 
D  be inducted into the Flyers Hall of Fame.
D  Brind’Amour played parts of nine seasons with the Flyers, 
D  collecting 601 points in 633 games.

D  practice

D  [/BYCREDIT]There’s a player on the Eagles with a concussion who 
D  has not been cleared to play, and his expected absence on Sunday 
D  against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will have a major effect on the 
D  offense.
D  The player is Ryan Mathews.
D  Although Sam Bradford’s concussion captured much of the attention 
D  this week, Mathews is also out with a concussion. The Eagles’ 
D  productive No.<TH>2 running back has not even made an appearance 
D  on the sideline during practice, and it does not appear that he 
D  will play on Sunday. That puts the onus on DeMarco Murray and 
D  Darren Sproles to carry the running game.
D  But there’s a dose of good news about the players blocking in 
D  front of them. Left tackle Jason Peters’ on-again, off-again 
D  relationship with practice continued on Thursday, when he returned 
D  to the practice field despite a back injury that has kept him out 
D  Wednesday’s session — not to mention the last two games. He was 
D  listed as limited, but he “took a lot of reps,” according to right 
D  tackle Lane Johnson.
D  “Close to normal,” Johnson said. “It was good seeing him back out 
D  there.”
D  There is so much mystery surrounding Peters’ status that even 
D  coach Chip Kelly did not know Peters would practice Thursday. Just 
D  minutes before practice started, Kelly told reporters that Peters 
D  would not practice and is still going through rehab. By the time 
D  Kelly arrived at practice, Peters was in uniform, ready to go.
D  Peters’ status wasn’t determined until two hours before the game 
D  on Sunday. That’s when Johnson found out he would need to play 
D  left tackle. Johnson expects to play right tackle this week.
D  However, he likely won’t block for Mathews, who averages 5.7 yards 
D  per carry and has been the Eagles’ most productive running back 
D  this season. His absence would give Murray a bigger role — Murray 
D  averages 16 carries per game — and it could also mean that Sproles 
D  gets more touches after carrying three times last Sunday. Reserve 
D  Kenjon Barner would also be in the lineup.
D  “You still have that tough, big, hard-nosed, physical running 
D  back,” Kelly said. “The other two running backs are obviously 
D  Sprolesy, who is a different type of running back, \[and Murray\]. 
D  We use a different approach when Darren’s in the backfield, and 
D  then Kenjon Barner would be up and be active on game day.”
D  When Murray is in the game, it’s worth watching how he collects 
D  the handoffs from Mark Sanchez, who is expected to start in 
D  Bradford’s place. There was confusion about when Sanchez would 
D  hand Murray the ball last Sunday. Sanchez carries out the read 
D  element of the zone read more often than Bradford. Sanchez and 
D  Murray have been working on their handoffs this week.
D  “Obviously, not working with each other throughout the course of 
D  the year and working with Sam, not necessarily reading it,” Murray 
D  said of the problem. “Mark coming in more of a runner. We got it 
D  fixed this week, so it shouldn’t be a problem moving forward.”
D  The Eagles will be challenged by the Tampa Bay rushing defense 
D  that allows just 3.6 yards per carry — the third-lowest total in 
D  the NFL. The Eagles’ rushing offense struggled against the 
D  Dolphins’ rushing defense last week even though it entered the 
D  game as the second-worst unit in the league. So statistics can be 
D  deceiving in both directions. The success of the running game 
D  often comes down to the effectiveness of the offensive line and 
D  not the quality of defense the Eagles face.
D  “It’s so hard to play 11 against 1,” Johnson said. “If one guy 
D  doesn’t do their job, our offense really can’t run.”
D  The Bucs defense is led by defensive tackle Gerald McCoy, one of 
D  the best defensive linemen in the NFL, and linebacker Lavonte 
D  David, who is consistently one of the league’s top tacklers. 
D  Murray mentioned them both when sizing up what to expect on 
D  Sunday.
D  How the Eagles run the ball could dictate the result on Sunday. 
D  The Eagles average 159.8 rushing yards per game in wins but only 
D  83.4 in losses. They’ll likely need to do it on Sunday without 
D  Mathews for the first time this season, although they could have 
D  Peters back in the lineup.

D  [BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER[/BYCREDIT]
D  [KERN-2]Lawyers opposed to the NFL’s plan to compensate thousands 
D  of former players for the long-term health effects of repeated 
D  concussions urged a federal appeals court in Philadelphia on 
D  Thursday to overturn the potential $1 billion deal.[/KERN-2]
D  Representing about 90 players who have called the settlement 
D  unfair, the lawyers argued that it includes an arbitrary cutoff 
D  date that would deny relief to those diagnosed in the future with 
D  one of football’s signature diseases.
D  Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), a degenerative brain 
D  disorder that has been linked to player suicide, including that of 
D  San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau, can only be diagnosed 
D  after death.
D  But, attorney Steven F. Molo told a three-judge panel of the U.S. 
D  Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit: “You can die with C.T.E. 
D  the day before the settlement approval and get $4 million. Die the 
D  day after and you get nothing. That’s not right.”
D  Other lawyers complained the deal offers compensation for only a 
D  select group of neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s 
D  disease and dementia, while ignoring others such as depression and 
D  mood disorders.
D  [KERN-2]But their arguments were largely greeted with skepticism 
D  from the judges.[/KERN-2]
D  “So the settlement should be watered down now by every field goal 
D  kicker who is depressed?” Judge Thomas M. Hardiman asked.
D  The deal’s architects — a group of attorneys representing the 
D  retirees and the lawyers for the NFL — accused the settlement’s 
D  critics of “fundamentally misunderstanding” what it was designed 
D  to do.
D  <NO1>Samuel Issacharoff, representing the players’ negotiators, 
D  said that the deal was set up to provide financial aid to retirees 
D  suffering from conditions that have been cited as possible C.T.E. 
D  markers while they are still alive.
D  In court filings, he and his colleagues have cited the case of 
D  former Eagles running back Kevin Turner, whose Lou Gehrig’s 
D  disease has left him severely debilitated.
D  <NO>“This is not a settlement that purports to cover every 
D  possible consequence that comes from a life playing football,” 
D  said Samuel Issacharoff<NO1>CQ<NO>, representing the players’ 
D  negotiators. “This settlement is largely an insurance policy for 
D  every living class member.”
D  Approved by U.S. District Judge Anita Brody in April, the <NO1>
D  settlement marked a significant step in ending what has become one 
D  of the most protracted and publicly debated fights in the history 
D  of the league.
D  The<NO>deal provides payouts as high as $5<TH>million for the 
D  sickest players. NFL auditors estimate that more than 6,000 of the 
D  currently living NFL retirees could be eligible to collect an 
D  average payment of $190,000 over the next 65 years.
D  Notably though, the settlement does not require the NFL to address 
D  allegations that have dogged it for years that top executives knew 
D  the risks and long-term complications of concussions and hid it 
D  from players.
D  Retirees who accept will not have to prove in court that their 
D  mental impairments are directly tied to injuries sustained during 
D  their time playing professional football.
D  <NO1>Under the terms, former players would be compensated on a 
D  sliding scale based on age, the number of seasons played, and 
D  whether post-career injuries might have contributed to their 
D  diagnoses.
D  Maximum awards of $5 million would go to players under age 45 who 
D  played five or more seasons in the NFL and require extensive 
D  treatment over their lifetimes for conditions such as Parkinson’s 
D  and Lou Gehrig’s disease.
D  The deal also provides funds for medical monitoring of currently 
D  healthy former players and an additional $10 million to fund 
D  education about concussions.
D  <NO>Of the 21,000 potentially eligible former players, fewer than 
D  1<TH>percent have opted out of the class-action settlement and 
D  chosen to take their chances alone in court — a sign Circuit Judge 
D  Thomas L. Ambro took Thursday as an indicator that most found the 
D  agreement to be fair.
D  “This is a settlement most people perceived at the outset as a 
D  good one — though highly unlikely,” he said. “And yet it has 
D  occurred … That would suggest the \[negotiators\] did a pretty 
D  good job.”
D  The appeals court is expected to issue its ruling in the coming 
D  months. Payouts to individual players cannot begin until all 
D  appeals are settled.

D  punch
E  HEAD

E  CONTENTS
D  [BYCREDIT]ASSOCIATED PRESS
D  [/BYCREDIT]Karlos Williams can’t imagine anyone in the NFL having 
D  a more ideal backup role than the one he has in Buffalo playing 
D  behind LeSean McCoy. 
D  “I’m just blessed to be able to have him go out there and tear 
D  them up and loosen up their ankles,” the Bills rookie running back 
D  said referring to McCoy on Thursday. “And for me to be able to 
D  pound the ball down their throats is definitely amazing.” 
D  After both were slowed by injuries in the first seven weeks of the 
D  season, the combination of McCoy’s razzle-dazzle and Williams’ 
D  mow-them-down styles is finally providing the Bills offense the 
D  “ground-and-pound” running attack coach Rex Ryan first envisioned 
D  when he took over in January. 
D  Over the last two weeks, McCoy, a former Eagle, and Williams have 
D  combined for 378 yards rushing and four touchdowns — including one 
D  receiving — in helping Buffalo (5-4) win consecutive games for the 
D  first time this season. 
D  And it’s a one-two punch that has allowed Williams to score a 
D  touchdown in each of his first six career games to match the NFL 
D  record set by New England’s Robert Edwards in 1998. He will have a 
D  shot to break the record against the Patriots (9-0) in an AFC East 
D  showdown on Monday night. 
D  <NO1>“I try not to worry about it,” said Williams, who has five 
D  touchdowns rushing and two receiving in between missing three 
D  games because of a concussion. “I’ll be blessed that it keeps 
D  happening. But if it doesn’t, then that’s fine. I just want to go 
D  out there and get a win.” 
D  As for McCoy, who was acquired in a trade with the Eagles in 
D  February, he is finally beginning to find his groove after opening 
D  the season hampered by a strained left hamstring he first hurt in 
D  training camp. McCoy has had 112 yards rushing in each of his last 
D  two games in helping the Bills rushing totals jump from 11th in 
D  the NFL to second entering this week. 
D  “Just feeling good again, feeling quick,” said McCoy, who took two 
D  weeks off last month to rest the injury. “I feel like myself.”
D  The NFL’s 2013 leading rusher is looking like it, too. 
D  After managing just six runs of 10 yards or more in his first 
D  three games of the season, McCoy had six alone in a 22-17 win 
D  against the New York Jets and the NFL’s top-ranked run defense on 
D  Nov. 12. 
D  Williams has continued to produce in a complementary role. 
D  Limited to just eight touches against the Jets, Williams scored on 
D  a 26-yard catch in which he sneaked out of the backfield, and was 
D  wide open cutting into the middle when quarterback Tyrod Taylor 
D  hit him in stride. 
D  <NO>[SUBHED_1]Cardinals’ Iupati returns
D  [/SUBHED_1]Arizona left guard Mike Iupati returned to practice 
D  just four days after he was taken off the field in Seattle in an 
D  ambulance. 
D  [KERN-2]Iupati was injured during a violent collision with the 
D  Seahawks’ Kam Chancellor in the second quarter of Arizona’s 39-32 
D  victory. 
D  [/KERN-2]“It was scary,” Iupati said. “When your neck hurts and 
D  both of your arms go numb, it’s a scary feeling.” 
D  [10PTLEAD]Elsewhere:[/10PTLEAD] Jets wide receiver Quincy Enunwa 
D  rejoined the team following a four-game suspension for violating 
D  the NFL’s personal-conduct policy. … <WC1>New York Jets coach Todd 
D  Bowles<WC> said <WC1>Ryan Fitzpatrick will be under center against 
D  the Houston Texans on Sunday<WC>.

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Bradford misses another practice
D  [/WEBHEAD][BYLINE]By Zach Berman
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]<NO>[AGATE_LG][INDENT]Sam Bradford still has not 
D  practiced this week because of a concussion. His absence on 
D  Thursday meant he missed the two most intense workdays of the week 
D  for the Eagles, so his status for Sunday’s game against the Tampa 
D  Bay remains in serious doubt even though he has not been ruled out 
D  officially. Mark Sanchez is expected to start at quarterback.
D  It seems as if Bradford is in the second stage of the five-step 
D  concussion protocol. He is allowed at meetings, but he is not 
D  doing any cardiovascular or strength work. Only once this season 
D  has an Eagles player missed Wednesday and Thursday practices and 
D  played on Sunday.
D  [KERN-1]“It’s all on an individual basis: Who is available? What’s 
D  up, what’s down?” Kelly said. “So we deal with it on an individual 
D  basis. Obviously, if you don’t practice, it sets you back a little 
D  bit because you don’t get a chance to do things full speed in the 
D  game plan, but there is not a set rule that you have to do [ITALIC]
D  this[/ITALIC] and [ITALIC]this[/ITALIC]. It just depends on 
D  everybody’s individual situation.”
D  [/KERN-1]Kelly had no update on Bradford’s left shoulder injury, 
D  which is a shoulder separation, according to a source. Kelly said 
D  the concussion is the “No.<TH>1 thing.”
D  [SUBHED_1]Barwin’s back 
D  [/SUBHED_1]Linebacker Connor Barwin returned to practice on a 
D  limited basis after missing the last two days. Barwin had a 
D  quadriceps injury. He said it was a bruise and he will be able to 
D  play on Sunday. 
D  Wide receiver Josh Huff was a new addition to the injury report 
D  with a back injury, but he said he would play on Sunday.
D  In addition to Bradford, Huff and running back Ryan Mathews 
D  (concussion), the Eagles were also missing offensive lineman Josh 
D  Andrews (concussion) and safety Jerome Couplin (shoulder). Neither 
D  player is expected to play against Tampa Bay. Left tackle Jason 
D  Peters was listed as limited because of a back injury.
D  [SUBHED_1]Extra points
D  [/SUBHED_1]The Eagles are hosting an online healthy food drive 
D  throughout November to benefit the Coalition Against Hunger’s 
D  Green Light Pantries. Information is online at 
D  www.hungercoalition.org.

D  [/BYCREDIT]SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — For one stretch, Temple looked 
D  nothing like the team that had appeared to be in command of 
D  Minnesota in the first round of the Puerto Rico Tip-Off on 
D  Thursday.
D  Two seniors — and a big play from a freshman guard — turned 
D  matters around for the Owls.
D  Recovering from a 6<MD+,%21,%70,%70>1<MD><CS4>/</CS>
D  <MD-,%0,%70,%70>2</MD><MD>-minute field-goal drought in the second 
D  half, Temple turned to seniors Devin Coleman and Jaylen Bond down 
D  the stretch, with guard Trey Lowe chipping in at just the right 
D  time, and the Owls went on to a 75-70 victory at Coliseo Roberto 
D  Clemente.
D  Temple (1-1) will face Butler in the second round on Friday.
D  “We did a good job getting that lead, then we obviously played 
D  poorly to lose it, then we got it together again,” Temple coach 
D  Fran Dunphy said. “I hope that’s a sign of things to come for us.
D  “Certainly losing the lead, we gave the ball up three times in a 
D  row, and that’s a format for disaster there, and we didn’t guard 
D  as well as we needed to.”
D  Bond scored a team-high 19 points, including two putbacks in the 
D  second half, and Coleman scored 15. Coleman’s three-pointer from 
D  the left wing with 7 minutes, 2 seconds left ended a 17-2 run that 
D  had enabled the Golden Gophers (2-1) to take a 56-50 lead with 
D  7:49 left.
D  “Once we saw that one shot fall, it sparked things,” Bond said. 
D  “Once that shot fell, we were able to open up our offense.”
D  Temple extended a five-point halftime lead to 48-39 with 13:47 
D  left. That’s when Minnesota took charge behind center Bakary 
D  Konate, who led a unit that held Temple to two free throws during 
D  the run.
D  Coleman’s three-pointer cut the Owls’ deficit to 56-53, then Lowe 
D  drove to the basket after a steal from Levan Alston and converted 
D  a three-point play to tie it at 56 with 6:41 left.
D  <NO1>Down 58-56, Coleman tied the game with two free throws, and a 
D  minute later, Bond’s offensive rebound and basket gave Temple a 
D  60-58 advantage.
D  <NO>With 3:45 left, Coleman’s three-pointer from the left corner 
D  capped a 15-2 run and Temple was back in charge.
D  “It’s a situation where we’re down and we try to just keep our 
D  heads up and know that we’ve got to execute better and defend a 
D  little better in order to pull ourselves back up,” Coleman said. 
D  “Sometimes, you just don’t make shots. 
D  “We weren’t executing as well as we needed to or playing as hard 
D  as we needed to. Thankfully, after however long it was, we got one 
D  to fall. It seemed to open things up a little bit.”
D  Guard Quenton DeCosey added 12 points and forward Obi Enechionyia 
D  came off the bench to score 14 for Temple, which had 17 assists on 
D  23 baskets and committed only eight turnovers.
D  “Obi’s an ‘X’ factor for us,” Dunphy said of the 6-foot-9 
D  sophomore. “He shoots the ball so well. I don’t remember him 
D  missing seven shots. He’s such a dangerous jump shooter, you hope 
D  he can go on some runs like he did today.”
D  Guard Nate Mason led Minnesota with 20 points, and guard Carlos 
D  Morris added 16. Sharpshooting forward Joey King stung the Owls a 
D  couple of times but was limited by foul trouble and finished with 
D  10 points.
D  “We’r</MD>e learning more about our team and who’s going to step 
D  up and at what time,” Dunphy said. “We have some pretty good 
D  senior leadership. Jaylen Bond and Devin Coleman played very well 
D  today.”

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Darryl Reynolds toughens up Villanova’s 
D  frontcourt 
D  [/WEBHEAD][BYLINE]By Mike Jensen 
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER 
D  [/BYCREDIT]<NO>The standard cynic’s thought on Villanova’s hoops 
D  season — the way to write them off before the Wildcats really get 
D  started —  is to suggest they’ll inevitably lose the way they went 
D  down last season, getting manhandled inside.
D  Maybe, but don’t put it in stone.
D  [KERN-2]Acknowledge that Villanova’s perimeter guys will be a 
D  handful for any opponent. Maryland might be ranked third 
D  nationally right now, but the grapevine — indirectly from the 
D  Maryland staff — says the Terps had a terrible time dealing with 
D  ’Nova’s guards in a closed scrimmage, that Villanova very much got 
D  the best of the matchup. 
D  [/KERN-2]An early scrimmage is far different from an NCAA game. 
D  But take a close look at Villanova early this season, even Friday 
D  against East Tennessee State. You’ll notice subtle differences, 
D  especially in the players Jay Wright is using off his bench.
D  Watch Darryl Reynolds come in for basically anybody on the floor 
D  and unless he’s spelling center Daniel Ochefu, Reynolds’ presence 
D  means Villanova is adding inside muscle. Not suggesting Reynolds 
D  will have a starring role. But watch the rebounds per minute — 
D  through two games, he’s got 11 in 35 minutes — and see the screens 
D  being set. The 6-foot-8 junior will get important rotation 
D  minutes, which means Villanova often gets bigger instead of 
D  smaller.
D  The other way ’Nova’s lineup may get bigger is when 6-7 redshirt 
D  freshman Mikal Bridges appears. Call Bridges the eighth man after 
D  Reynolds and Phil Booth, who is kind of the sixth starter this 
D  year, similar to what Josh Hart was last year.
D  Especially watch Bridges when Villanova presses this season. If 
D  he’s in, Bridges is probably up at the top of the press. He 
D  personally caused a couple of Nebraska turnovers, including when 
D  he tipped a pass and then sprawled to the floor at midcourt, 
D  causing a tie-up and a change of possession.
D  When did Wright know he was going to use Bridges in that role?
D  “The day he committed to us,” Wright said. “When we recruited him, 
D  we saw those arms.<TH>… Darrun Hilliard was great because of that, 
D  same thing. Dante Cunningham, we used to put there. Shane Clark, 
D  we used to put there sometimes.<TH>… Mikal is just a natural, he’s 
D  really good at it.”
D  Asked if Reynolds had gotten stronger, Wright said, “He was 
D  actually pretty strong when he came here. He got stronger. But he 
D  didn’t play that way. It was an evolution over a couple of years 
D  of just playing with confidence, and then his strength showed.”
D  Wright added that going against Ochefu has been a factor.
D  “Those two [ITALIC]kill[/ITALIC] each other in practice,” Wright 
D  said. “He makes Daniel a lot better and now he’s starting to play 
D  that way in games, which is big for us.”
D  Ochefu said of those practice battles, “Oh, man. I don’t even know 
D  how to explain it. It’s every day. When we wake up, it’s going to 
D  be me and him. There are no fouls in practice. Not as many fouls. 
D  So we’re just killing each other.”
D  Reynolds talks about how a little more is expected of him, that a 
D  goal is to be counted on. Not focusing on stats, he said. Getting 
D  out on guards on switches without fouling them. Setting screens is 
D  as important as anything that shows up in the stat sheet.
D  “Especially for me,” Reynolds said.
D  Sure, Villanova guards are the centerpiece. Reynolds knows that.
D  “My attitude towards that, this program has been like this since 
D  way before me and Daniel got here,” said Reynolds, who has an 
D  engaging way about him, even in a five-minute postgame 
D  conversation. “This program will be like this long after me and 
D  Daniel are gone.”
D  Reynolds said the guards playing bigger always are a key to the 
D  whole thing. But keep an eye on the guys who are working under the 
D  radar to keep the inside play from being an Achilles’ heel.
D  “We don’t take any offense to it,” Reynolds said of the guard 
D  emphasis.
D  And those wars with Ochefu? A battle that helped them both.
D  “Oh, my God,” Reynolds said. “Over the years, it’s just turned 
D  into something beautiful.”

D  assists and one steal in 27 minutes and looked like he was having 
D  even more fun setting hard picks for his teammates. 
D  By the end of the night, Indiana’s student section was chanting 
D  his first and last name, and Bryant was waving his arms to rile up 
D  the crowd. 
D  With Bryant playing that well, Creighton never had a chance. 
D  <NO1>The Bluejays, who averaged 98 points in their first two 
D  games, only had one other player reach double figures. Khyri 
D  Thomas scored 11 points.

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Penn State will miss safety Lucas in Michigan 
D  matchup 
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Joe Juliano 
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER 
D  [/BYCREDIT]The Penn State pass defense, which has been ranked near 
D  the top of the FBS rankings in yards allowed this season, will get 
D  a major test from Michigan quarterback Jake Rudock on Saturday in 
D  a senior day matchup against the 14th-ranked Wolverines at Beaver 
D  Stadium.
D  But the leader of the defense, senior cocaptain Jordan Lucas, will 
D  be watching from the sidelines.
D  The Nittany Lions’ starting strong safety suffered a season-ending 
D  injury in the first half of the team’s Nov.<TH>7 loss to 
D  Northwestern. Although Penn State did not disclose the nature of 
D  the injury, Lucas watched the second half of that game with his 
D  right arm in a sling.
D  “Losing Jordan, a guy who’s played a lot of football here, is a 
D  captain for us, that’s going to have an impact,” head coach James 
D  Franklin said. “Fortunately, we have played some other guys and 
D  that’s helpful. But whenever you’re going to lose a senior starter 
D  who’s played as much football as Jordan has<TH>… it’s going to 
D  have an impact. We’re aware of that.”
D  The loss of Lucas, who started 33 career games, second on the team 
D  among active Nittany Lions behind Christian Hackenberg’s 35, comes 
D  at an inopportune time. Penn State has allowed 159.0 yards per 
D  game through the air this season, second in the FBS.
D  Rudock, a graduate transfer from Iowa, passed for 440 yards and a 
D  school record six touchdowns Saturday in Michigan’s 48-41 
D  double-overtime win over Indiana. Wide receiver Jehu Chesson 
D  accounted for four scoring catches.
D  After failing to reach the 200-yard passing mark in six straight 
D  games, Rudock has accounted for 777 passing yards in the last two.
D  
D  Lucas will be replaced by junior Malik Golden, who has played in 
D  schemes with five and six defensive backs, and replaced Lucas when 
D  he sat out the San Diego State game earlier this season with an 
D  injury.
D  “We have to have the next guy ready to step up and that’s Malik,” 
D  cornerbacks coach Terry Smith said. “We have a really good defense 
D  and we expect Malik to step in and fill Jordan’s shoes and play 
D  equally well or better. That’s just the way we’re molded as a 
D  defense. Malik will be ready to step in and play well on 
D  Saturday.”

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Ryan O’Malley and Penn set for shot at Ivy 
D  League title 
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By John N. Mitchell 
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER 
D  [/BYCREDIT]When the 2014 football season ended with Penn going 
D  2-8, tight end Ryan O’Malley didn’t know what to expect in his 
D  final season as a Quaker.
D  “There was a lot of uncertainty, especially after the season ended 
D  with all the changes and with us not knowing what the future was 
D  going to be like,” said O’Malley, a fifth-year senior who has two 
D  receiving touchdowns this seasons.
D  O’Malley and his teammates had to adjust to longtime defensive 
D  coordinator Ray Priore replacing Al Bagnoli (23 seasons) as head 
D  coach. Penn struggled out of the gate to start the season at 1-3, 
D  but all along O’Malley felt good about what was happening.
D  “We never lost confidence in Coach and the coaching staff and each 
D  other,” O’Malley said. “We believed in the system, like Coach 
D  said, and now we’re here. It’s a little bit difficult to believe.”
D  
D  The Quakers (6-2, 5-1 Ivy) are one win away from clinching at 
D  least a piece of the league title, something they last did in 
D  2012. It would be their 17th Ivy League championship.
D  After beating Harvard last week, the Quakers are riding their 
D  first five-game winning streak since they won eight straight to 
D  end the 2010 season with the Ivy title.
D  Standing in their way is Cornell (1-8, 1-5), which earned its 
D  first win of the season last week, 3-0, against Columbia. Harvard 
D  (8-1, 5-1) is at Yale. Dartmouth (8-1, 5-1), the last team to beat 
D  the Quakers, hosts Princeton.
D  There hasn’t been a three-way tie for the title since 1982, when 
D  Penn, Dartmouth, and Harvard shared the championship. Penn last 
D  shared the title in 1988.
D  “We know what’s at stake here,” O’Malley said. “It’s a great 
D  opportunity<NO1> to be in<NO>.”
D  Many of Priore’s players say he has revitalized the Quakers with a 
D  more hands-on approach than his good friend and predecessor, 
D  Bagnoli. Priore said he’s certain the Quakers won’t overlook the 
D  competition. 
D  “We didn’t win anything last week other than a big game,” Priore 
D  said of the victory over Harvard. “Cornell has jumped out on some 
D  teams but wasn’t able to hold a lead. For us, we still don’t think 
D  we’ve played our best game of the season. This would be a good 
D  time for that.”

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Phil Mayhue: From Winslow Twp. walk-on to 
D  Memphis starter 
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Marc Narducci 
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER 
D  [/BYCREDIT]George Mayhue heard the news, dashed outside and 
D  screamed. Danyell Mayhue was at work when she got the news and she 
D  almost feinted. And then she screamed as well.
D  The parents of Memphis wide receiver Phil Mayhue were letting out 
D  shouts of joy, bottled-up emotion that burst out when they heard 
D  that their son’s hard work had paid off in a football scholarship.
D  
D  Phil Mayhue, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound 2013 graduate of South Jersey’s 
D  Winslow Township High, called his parents late in the summer to 
D  tell them that he was no-longer a preferred walk-on.
D  After a season at Atlanta Sports Academy prep school and then 
D  another at Memphis, he was going to receive a scholarship.
D  Phil Mayhue will have a brief family reunion this weekend when his 
D  Memphis team visits Temple on Saturday in an American Athletic 
D  Conference game at Lincoln Financial Field.
D  If Cincinnati beats South Florida on Friday night, Temple (8-2, 
D  5-1 AAC) can clinch the East Division title with a win. Memphis 
D  (8-2, 4-2) is looking to end a two-game slide.
D  Phil Mayhue had 15 receptions for 242 yards and two touchdowns 
D  last season as a walk-on freshman. This year he is second on the 
D  team with 41 receptions for 550 yards.
D  He certainly has justified the scholarship and his parents’ 
D  outbursts.
D  “I was so happy I was crying for five minutes,” said George 
D  Mayhue, who works for a local public works department. “I felt 
D  like a teenager and he worked so hard and deserved it.”
D  Added his mother, who works in an accounting department: “I was so 
D  relieved and when I first heard it, I couldn’t stop screaming.”
D  His parents said they made sacrifices to make sure the tuition 
D  from the prep school and the first year at Memphis was paid. “It 
D  got to the point where I skipped a mortgage payment,” Danyell 
D  said.
D  The mortgage payments are caught up and the Mayhues are enjoying 
D  their son’s career.
D  [KERN+1]Phil Mayhue played on a 0-10 team in his senior year in 
D  high school. He caught the eye of the Memphis coaches at prep 
D  school and they offered him the chance to be a preferred walk-on. 
D  Five of the top six receivers on the Tigers are former walk-ons.
D  [/KERN+1]“Earning the scholarship was like the best feeling ever, 
D  knowing you put in the work to get something accomplished and 
D  helping out my parents,” Phil Mayhue said. “One thing I was trying 
D  to do was help my parents.”
D  Memphis coach Justin Fuente said it was a great feeling to tell 
D  Mayhue he would be on scholarship.
D  “He has really been a joy for our program,” Fuente said. “We put 
D  him on scholarship because he earned it.<TH>… He is not all that 
D  old, but the younger guys have really looked up to him with the 
D  way he has conducted his business.”

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Memphis QB Paxton Lynch will test Owls 
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Marc Narducci 
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER 
D  [/BYCREDIT]Could a potential Eagles quarterback of the future be 
D  playing in their own stadium this weekend?
D  No doubt when Memphis (8-2 overall, 4-2 American Athletic 
D  Conference) visits Temple (8-2, 5-1) on Saturday at Lincoln 
D  Financial Field, Paxton Lynch will be a featured attraction among 
D  NFL scouts. 
D  The 6-foot-7, 245-pound Lynch has generated plenty of NFL buzz.
D  [KERN-3]“He has become a first-round quarterback,” Temple coach 
D  Matt Rhule said. “We have seen Teddy Bridgewater, \[Blake\] 
D  Bortles, and he is the next one.”
D  [/KERN-3]Temple played against Bridgewater at Louisville. He is 
D  now starting for the Minnesota Vikings. Bortles is starting for 
D  Jacksonville after competing for Central Florida. 
D  “Paxton can throw the ball 70 yards and he can run,” Rhule said.
D  This season the redshirt junior has completed 67.7 percent of his 
D  passes for 3,292 yards with 21 touchdowns and three interceptions. 
D  Lynch has rushed for 235 yards and two touchdowns. 
D  It’s not as if he has just burst on the scene. Lynch has been a 
D  starter since his redshirt freshman year. Last season he completed 
D  63 percent of his passes for 3,031 yards with 22 touchdowns and 
D  nine interceptions. But this season, he has taken the next step.
D  “I like the way he has handled some of the attention that has come 
D  his way,” Memphis coach Justin Fuente said in a conference call 
D  with reporters. “He has continued to understand the reason he has 
D  had some success is the way he goes about his business, has worked 
D  and been prepared.” 
D  When asked about Lynch, one NFL scout said it’s early in the 
D  process but indicated that his team has been impressed with what 
D  it has seen.
D  Draft analyst Mike Mayock of the NFL Network had a similar 
D  response. “I am very early in my tape-watching process, but he 
D  looks like a potential first-round pick if he comes out,” Mayock 
D  said.
D  Then for emphasis, Mayock added, “It is way early in the process.”
D  
D  While the fans’ thirst for draft news is insatiable, it is best to 
D  remember that the draft won’t take place until April 28-30.
D  Still, Mayock said he has extensively studied one tape of Lynch: 
D  Memphis’ 37-24 win over visiting Ole Miss on Oct.<TH>17. Lynch 
D  completed 39 of 53 passes for 384 yards with three touchdowns and 
D  one interception. 
D  “Ole Miss didn’t pressure and used a predominant three- to 
D  four-man rush and he had plenty of time to throw,” Mayock said. 
D  “He has good arm strength, probably not elite, but I need to see 
D  him in person.”
D  Fuente says Lynch has all the intangibles a coach is looking for.
D  “He has a great head on his shoulders and has improved physically, 
D  mentally, emotionally just kind of through the years at 
D  quarterback,” Fuente said. 
D  In a 16-13 win over Temple at Lincoln Financial Field last year, 
D  Lynch completed 21 of 28 passes for 230 yards with one touchdown 
D  and no interceptions. 
D  “He has deceptive speed,” said Temple cornerback Sean Chandler, a 
D  Camden High product who has returned two of his three 
D  interceptions for touchdowns. “He has a strong arm and will try to 
D  sneak in passes even when the receivers are covered.”
D  Memphis receiver Phil Mayhue, formerly of Winslow Township High, 
D  said Lynch is as talented as advertised.
D  “It is unbelievable to be with somebody so dynamic,” Mayhue said. 
D  “He’s always looking to get the ball in the right places.”

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Phila. Marathon front-runner is a Kenyan who 
D  lives in Roxborough 
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Frank Fitzpatrick
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]Sometimes as a youngster in the small Kenyan village 
D  where his family farmed, Abraham Kiprop Rutto would look up toward 
D  the clear sky and see a passing airplane.
D  Though his future figured to be as earthbound as his father’s, the 
D  boy dreamed that one day such a plane would carry him to strange 
D  new lands, no small ambition for a rural African youngster.
D  Soon he found a way.
D  “My friends were running and going abroad in planes,” Rutto said. 
D  “And I said, ‘I want to fly in one and go abroad so I will run 
D  too.’<TH>”
D  Rutto ran so hard he eventually caught up with his dream. In 2012, 
D  he flew to America, training at first in Colorado Springs, where 
D  the high-altitude terrain resembled Kenya’s. Then last year, he 
D  came to Philadelphia to train with agent-manager Hicham el 
D  Mohtadi.
D  On Sunday, in his new hometown, the 33-year-old Kenyan will be 
D  looking to fly again. Rutto will be among the favorites when the 
D  2015 Philadelphia Marathon is run over a historic and scenic 
D  course.
D  “He’s been training in Mexico and when he came off the plane 
D  Friday he looked really fit,” said el Mohtadi. “His face looked 
D  thin and that’s the first thing you look for in a runner. If you 
D  see the cheekbones, it means the athlete has been training really 
D  hard and losing weight.
D  “I used to run and when I was training well my face would look 
D  like I had malnutrition. That’s how Abraham looked.”
D  At 5-foot-8, 140 pounds, Rutto is more compact than many Kenyan 
D  runners. Still, the forearms he’ll be pumping, presumably at the 
D  front of the nearly 30,000 runners who will be competing in a 
D  marathon, half-marathon, and 8K race, will never be mistaken for 
D  Popeye’s.
D  But his diet, heavy on spinach, might be.
D  Despite his year in Roxborough, Rutto has never had a cheesesteak. 
D  
D  “Oh no,” he laughed when asked if he’d ever eaten one. “I like to 
D  cook and eat spinach and my cornmeal.”
D  El Mohtadi said the Kenyan diet is heavy in those ingredients, 
D  both of which are believed to supply a distance runner’s body with 
D  the energy that’s so essential.
D  “They mix the cornmeal and spinach in a dish called Ugali that’s 
D  very popular,” said el Mohtadi. “But he’s not a vegetarian. He 
D  also eats a lot of meat and a lot of chicken. And Abraham drinks a 
D  lot of something called mursik, which is what we call buttermilk.”
D  
D  Rutto, here on a professional athlete’s visa, has been training 
D  for this marathon in Taluca, Mexico, which is 9,000 feet above sea 
D  level.
D  “It is high-altitude, much like Kenya,” he said. “I am feeling 
D  really strong now and<NO1> am<NO> believe I am ready for this 
D  race.”
D  He has won at the 26.2-mile distance at the Colfax Marathon in 
D  Denver (2:14.32). But last year, in his first Philadelphia event, 
D  Rutto finished a disappointing eighth, his time of 2:22.58, more 
D  than 5 minutes behind winner Dan Vasallo. 
D  “I wasn’t in good shape for that marathon,” said Rutto, who has 
D  run an average of 115 miles a week, primarily through Fairmount 
D  Park, in preparation for this one.
D  [KERN-2]He hopes to beat 2:16:00 Sunday and if the weather and 
D  pace are ideal, he could easily challenge the event’s record, 
D  Ethiopian Joseph Ndiritu’s 2:16.47 in 2003.
D  [/KERN-2]His chief competition on the men’s side is expected to 
D  come from a fellow Kenyan, Philip Lagat, who won the 2014 
D  Cleveland Marathon with a time of 2:12.24.
D  The women’s marathon favorites include Mexico’s Gisela 
D  Olalde-Granados and Kate Papenberg of Colorado Springs.
D  Organizers are anticipating a slightly smaller field than in 2014 
D  for the event, whose route starts and ends at the Art Museum, 
D  passes by Independence Hall, through Old City, and into Manayunk 
D  and Fairmount Park.
D  [KERN-2]The relatively low winner’s prizes, each gets $3,500, 
D  likely has reduced the number of elite runners in the marathon’s 
D  field. And last month’s Rock ‘n’ Roll half-marathon here has 
D  diminished the competitors in that event.
D  [/KERN-2][KERN-1]Male marathoners can qualify for February’s 
D  Olympic Trials by breaking 2:18:00 while the standard for females 
D  is 2:43:00.
D  [/KERN-1]“I expect Abraham to run well,” said el Mohdati. “This is 
D  his job, to run in these events and win the prize money that keeps 
D  him going. He trains too hard to work a regular job, running six 
D  days a week, twice a day.
D  “He’s a very nice guy, very respectful. He’s not married yet. He’s 
D  saving up to one day go home and find a wife.”
D  And wherever their honeymoon is, they’ll undoubtedly get there on 
D  a plane.

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER 
D  [/BYCREDIT]Blanca Fernandez e-mailed American colleges last year, 
D  hoping to leave Spain and earn her master’s degree on an athletic 
D  scholarship. Fernandez was an elite runner at home, good enough to 
D  race with the Spanish national team. But she did not know what to 
D  expect. 
D  America is a big place, Fernandez thought. There might not be room 
D  on a team. Temple e-mailed back. The Owls were interested. So were 
D  two other schools. Fernandez picked Temple for its urban campus, 
D  its sports business program and the European vibe she felt in 
D  Philadelphia.
D  Fernandez met with Temple’s coaches in January. She did not know 
D  what to expect. Fernandez told them, “Let’s see what happens.” 
D  What happened was a trip to the NCAA indoor championships in March 
D  and a trip to the outdoor championships in June. She returned to 
D  school in the summer. Fernandez knew what to expect. 
D  Fernandez told her coaches that she wanted to finish the 
D  cross-country season with a top-15 placement at the NCAA 
D  championships, which she will race in on Saturday in Louisville, 
D  Ky. She is the first Temple women’s runner ever to reach the NCAA 
D  championship. 
D  Her goal is within reach. Fernandez is undefeated in all six of 
D  her races this season. She won last week’s Mid-Atlantic Regional, 
D  navigating the 6k course at Princeton in 20 minutes, 52 seconds. 
D  Kentucky’s warmer weather should allow Fernandez to challenge for 
D  a top spot.
D  “People say, ‘Oh, you won six. Why not win seven?’ Fernandez said. 
D  “But this is completely different. This is going to be the whole 
D  country. You can find people that are amazing. The race is going 
D  to be pretty tough.”
D  Fernandez, 23, will be joined in the race by La Salle’s Morgan 
D  Szekely and Penn’s Ashley Montgomery. Villanova’s Patrick Tiernan, 
D  Robert Denault, and Jordan Williamsz<NO1> cq <NO> will compete in 
D  the men’s race. The Penn men’s team and Penn State and Villanova 
D  women’s teams also qualified.
D  “I just want to enjoy it,” Fernandez said. “It’s the top 
D  competition that you can race against. I feel pretty good to say 
D  that I’m ready to go. The amount of people on the starting line is 
D  not going to be different than the other races, but the level of 
D  those runners is going to be the difference.”
D  After Saturday, Fernandez’s focus will shift to the indoor season 
D  as she begins her preparations to earn a spot in next summer’s 
D  Olympic Games. Fernandez’ sights are set on qualifying in the 
D  5,000 meter race, a race she has never ran on the track. But her 
D  success in the outdoor season gives her confidence. Her 
D  cross-country races are 1,000 meters longer than the Olympic 
D  event.
D  Fernandez told her coaches of her decision to qualify in the 
D  5,000-meter race instead of her original goal of the 1,500. Her 
D  coaches laid out a plan. The runner knows what to expect. She will 
D  focus on the 3,000-meter race during the indoor season before 
D  stretching to 5,000 meters in the outdoor campaign. 
D  Fernandez then will spend her last months at Temple chasing an 
D  Olympic qualifying time of 15:20. If she reaches that, she will 
D  need to finish in the top three in July at Spain’s national meet. 
D  And then in August, she could be off to Rio De Janeiro for the 
D  Olympics.
D  “It’s the top goal for any athlete,” Fernandez said. “You always 
D  dream of that, but it is so high that sometimes you say, ‘That is 
D  not for me. It’s too much.’ But now for me, I’m training for that, 
D  so why not? It’s hard to explain.”

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Brown: Sixers excited about road trip ‘in a 
D  sadistic way’
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Keith Pompey 
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER 
D  [/BYCREDIT]It was an obvious question, one that 76ers fans were 
D  dying to get answered.
D  After a 112-85 setback to the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, coach 
D  Brett Brown was asked if he allows himself to say, “I thought it 
D  was going to be better than this by now.” Do those thoughts creep 
D  into his mind after a humbling setback like that?
D  “At times, I’m sure it does for everybody,” Brown said. “But you 
D  take that group, and I’m saying it and I mean it: That \[loss\] is 
D  an outlier. That’s an outlier.
D  “We’ve laid eggs before in all of the years. Some of the West 
D  Coast trips we’ve come back very humble.”
D  But Wednesday night marked game No.<TH>176 of the rebuilding 
D  process. It might as well had been game No.<TH>12, as the Sixers 
D  (0-12) struggled mightily in their 22d consecutive loss dating 
D  back to March<TH>27.
D  Their turnover total of 31 was the highest in the NBA since the 
D  Golden State Warriors had 31 against the Memphis Grizzlies on 
D  Nov.<TH>8, 2000.
D  This wasn’t an isolated incident. They committed a combined 58 
D  turnovers in the last two games. The Sixers also average a 
D  league-worst 19.1 turnovers per game. They’re on pace for the 
D  worst turnover mark of any NBA team since the San Antonio Spurs 
D  averaged 20.8 during the 1988-89 season.
D  <NO1>If they were a difference Wednesday, <NO>The Sixers looked 
D  Wednesday like a team that quit long before the final buzzer had 
D  sounded.
D  “So for everybody, games like tonight you scratch your head and 
D  say, ‘We want more,’<TH>” Brown said. “We expect more. We should 
D  be further ahead.
D  “Further ahead we will be if we can keep the group focused and 
D  people healthy.”
D  Nerlens Noel is playing with knee tendinitis and soreness in his 
D  right wrist. Robert Covington has played two games, missing the 
D  previous seven with a right knee <NO1>MCL<NO>ligament sprain.
D  Richaun Holmes (right hamstring sprain) has missed the last four 
D  games. Tony Wroten (right ACL tear), Kendall Marshall (right ACL 
D  tear), Carl Landry (torn ligament right wrist), and Joel Embiid 
D  (season-ending broken navicular bone) have yet to play this 
D  season.
D  “I think now is the time that we get excited in a sadistic way to 
D  go on the road for this long, difficult road trip and try to get 
D  bunker mentality and try to spend time with each other,” Brown 
D  said.
D  The Sixers start a six-game road trip Friday against the Charlotte 
D  Hornets before facing the Miami Heat on Saturday. Then they’ll 
D  face the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Boston Celtics, the Houston 
D  Rockets, and the Memphis Grizzlies to end the trip on Nov.<TH>29.
D  While some of fans are growing weary, this is all part of the 
D  franchise’s process. The Sixers are built to take humiliating 
D  losses in this the third season of tanking.
D  Nine of the 12 Sixers to play this season are either second-round 
D  picks or undrafted players. Forty-three percent of the team’s 
D  payroll goes to players who have been waived.
D  While they’re mostly a new set of players, the results have been 
D  the same as — if not worse than — the previous seasons.
D  They rank last in the NBA in points (90.5 per game) and scoring 
D  margin (minus-14) and are tied for last with the Memphis Grizzlies 
D  (34.1) in made field goals. They also lead the league in 
D  turnovers.

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]Giroux a fan of new NHL all-star format 
D  [/WEBHEAD][BYLINE]By Sam Carchidi
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER 
D  [/BYCREDIT]<NO>[AGATE_LG][INDENT]Center Claude Giroux, who figures 
D  to be the Flyers’ lone all-star representative this season, likes 
D  the new three-on-three format the league has created for the 
D  Jan.<TH>31 game in Nashville.
D  Instead of the traditional All-Star Game, players representing the 
D  four divisions will have three 20-minute contests in the 
D  tournament, which will have two semifinal games followed by the 
D  championship.
D  “It’s going to be pretty exciting to play and it’s going to be 
D  pretty exciting for our fans,” Giroux said. “It’s up-and-down 
D  hockey, and there’s going to be a lot of skills in those games.”
D  Each team will have three defensemen, six forwards, and two 
D  goalies. The league is piggybacking on the wildly exciting, 
D  three-on-three overtime format it has adopted this season.
D  “When you play three-on-three, you see a shot on one net and 
D  two-on-one the other way; it goes back and forth,” winger Wayne 
D  Simmonds said. “It’s an exciting brand of hockey. I don’t know if 
D  you want to necessarily do it all the time — thank God we don’t do 
D  it in the playoffs — but it’s exciting for the all-star format.”
D  Simmonds smiled.
D  “The game’s probably going to end 30-20,” he said.
D  [SUBHED_1]Couturier’s struggles
D  [/SUBHED_1]Sean Couturier, slowed by a concussion earlier this 
D  season, entered Thursday’s matchup with visiting San Jose with 
D  just one goal and three points in his 12 games.
D  Now in his fifth season with the Flyers, Couturier was sidelined 
D  for six games from Oct.<TH>24 to Nov.<TH>3. Since returning, he 
D  has steadied the penalty-killing units but had no points in six 
D  games<NO1> entering Thursday<NO>.
D  “That’s tough, the amount of time he missed with the injury,” 
D  coach Dave Hakstol said Thursday after the morning skate. “Coming 
D  back on that West Coast swing, I thought his adrenaline and energy 
D  for the first couple games was good, but probably as expected, in 
D  order to get your game conditioning back, it’s taken him a couple 
D  games.”
D  Couturier, who turns 23 on Dec.<TH>7, has been centering Matt Read 
D  (three goals, five points) and Simmonds (three goals, six points).
D  
D  “I think he and his line have been good,” Hakstol said. <NO1>“When 
D  you look at the matchups they’ve had and the overall performance 
D  they’ve had in those matchups, I think he’s done a good job. He’s 
D  producing opportunities, he’s playing good two-way hockey and he’s 
D  bringing a competitive leadership.”<NO>
D  Still,  the Flyers need more from the three players. Heading into 
D  Thursday, Simmonds was minus-10, Read was minus-6, and Couturier 
D  was minus-4.

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]PHILLY.COM
D  [/BYCREDIT]After months of waiting, Philadelphia has been 
D  confirmed as a host city for next summer’s much-anticipated Copa 
D  America Centenario soccer tournament.
D  Lincoln Financial Field will be one of 10 venues across the United 
D  States for the event, which will feature the top national teams 
D  from across North, Central and South America. Games will be played 
D  between June 3 and 26. Each stadium will host several contests, 
D  according to tournament organizers, with most expected to host at 
D  least three.
D  So the odds are strong that Philadelphia will get a marquee 
D  matchup featuring the United States, Lionel Messi’s Argentina, 
D  five-time World Cup champion Brazil, or other star-studded teams 
D  such as Chile, Colombia and Mexico.
D  “We’re ecstatic for this city to have the opportunity to host some 
D  of biggest international games on the 2016 calendar,” said Union 
D  executive vice president Dave Rowan, whose team worked with the 
D  Eagles and the Philadelphia Sports Congress to bring a piece of 
D  the event here.
D  The rest of the field includes Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, 
D  Uruguay, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Jamaica, and the winners of two 
D  upcoming CONCACAF playoff series: Trinidad and Tobago vs. Haiti 
D  and Panama vs. Cuba.
D  <NO1>Jamaica's presence in the field means that the Union will 
D  likely have representation in the tournament, as starting 
D  goalkeeper Andre Blake also backstops the Reggae Boys. Many of the 
D  other teams involved also have players in Major League Soccer, 
D  from Costa Rica (Johan Venegas, Montreal Impact) to Paraguay 
D  (Nelson Valdez, Seattle Sounders) and even Brazil (Kaka, Orlando 
D  City).
D  MLS would likely schedule a break in its 2016 calendar, as it does 
D  during World Cup years, so that as many of its players as possible 
D  can participate in the tournament without harming their club 
D  teams. No official decision has been made yet, though.
D  The creation of the Copa América Centenario was originally 
D  announced last year, and the set of host venues was initially 
D  scheduled to be confirmed this past May. But that announcement was 
D  postponed when the FBI and Department of Justice unveiled their 
D  investigation into corruption in global soccer. 
D  Included in the investigation's scope was the sale of marketing 
D  rights for the tournament, which was created as a special 
D  centennial edition of South America's biennial national team 
D  championship. Continental governing body CONMEBOL, which runs the 
D  Copa América, joined with North/Central American governing body 
D  CONCACAF to put together an event likely to bring soccer its 
D  biggest spotlight in the United States since the 1994 men's and 
D  1999 women's World Cups.
D  Not surprisingly, given the many corrupt officials in both 
D  CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, the Centenario tournament quickly became a 
D  jackpot of greed, graft and bribery. 
D  U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch's sweeping indictment unveiled 
D  in May laid out dramatic details of behind-the-scenes deals. Among 
D  the highlights: Datisa, a South American company which was created 
D  for the specific purpose of securing the tournament's global 
D  commercial rights, paid $110 million in bribes to a range of 
D  CONMEBOL and CONCACAF officials
D  One of the investors in Datisa was Traffic Sports, a 
D  Brazilian-based company with a substantial U.S.-based operation. 
D  Its holdings include World Cup qualifying game television rights 
D  for almost every CONCACAF nation except the United States and 
D  Mexico, and an equity stake in the second-tier North American 
D  Soccer League.
D  When the U.S. government moved to charge officials at CONMEBOL, 
D  Traffic and other entities, the U.S. Soccer Federation began 
D  working to sever the event's ties to marketing agencies that 
D  helped enable that corruption. 
D  In September, U.S. Soccer threatened to pull out of hosting the 
D  tournament if certain guarantees about cleaning up the event were 
D  not met. That included removing Datisa, whose United States assets 
D  were reportedly frozen by the federal government.
D  CQ:

D  http://www.espnfc.us/copa-america/story/2618065/copa-america-in-us-
D  still-possible-concacaf
D  After a meeting in Mexico City involving high-level continental 
D  soccer and television executives, CONMEBOL announced in 
D  mid-October that it had officially ended its relationship with 
D  Datisa.

D  would proceed, that it would be played in the United States, and 
D  that a new marketing agency would take over the commercial rights.

D  [/BYCREDIT]NEW YORK — Bryce Harper became the youngest unanimous 
D  MVP winner in baseball history Thursday, capturing the NL award 
D  even though his Washington Nationals missed the playoffs. 
D  Josh Donaldson took the AL MVP, earning the honor after helping 
D  boost the Toronto Blue Jays back into the postseason for the first 
D  time since 1993. 
D  Harper turned 23 on Oct.<TH>16, after the playoffs had already 
D  started. He got all 30 first-place votes from members of the 
D  Baseball Writers’ Association of America. 
D  The 2012 NL rookie of the year led the majors in slugging 
D  percentage and on-base average. The outfielder hit .330 with 42 
D  home runs and 99 RBIs. 
D  <NO1>Harper was the first player from a Washington franchise to 
D  win an MVP — no one on the original or expansion Senators or Nats 
D  had done it. 
D  Harper was the fourth-youngest player overall to win an MVP, with 
D  Stan Musial, Johnny Bench and Vida Blue also 22 but not quite as 
D  old. 
D  <NO>[KERN-0]Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt was second in 
D  the voting and Cincinnati first baseman Joey Votto was third. 
D  Yoenis Cespedes, acquired by the Mets from Detroit at the July 31 
D  trade deadline, finished 13th.
D  [/KERN-0]<NO1>Harper put aside his injury problems from recent 
D  seasons and put up huge numbers. The banged-up Nationals didn’t do 
D  nearly so well, starting the season as World Series favorites and 
D  finishing far out of contention. 
D  Harper missed a lot of games in 2013 after a pair of run-ins with 
D  walls, then was sidelined for much of 2014 following a headfirst 
D  slide that hurt his thumb. 
D  This year, Harper reported to spring training with one goal — the 
D  only number he focused on was games played. 
D  Harper finished with a .649 slugging percentage and a .460 on-base 
D  average. He went into the final day of the regular season with a 
D  chance to win the NL batting title — Miami’s Dee Gordon edged him 
D  — and scored a league-leading 118 runs. 
D  The three-time All-Star also continued to draw fans in the 
D  Washington area and beyond. His constantly changing hairstyles are 
D  always getting attention and the selfie he took in the outfield 
D  before a game at Nationals Park this season boosted his popularity 
D  even more. 
D  His hitting, though, is what makes him so special. 
D  <NO>“You could see throughout the season what this guy meant to 
D  this ball club. And don’t forget, this guy carried us throughout 
D  the whole season,” Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said.
D  <NO1>“Every team that we played circled his name and said, ‘This 
D  guy’s not going to beat us.’ And with that said, he beat a lot of 
D  teams. So it was a remarkable season. As we said at this time last 
D  year, I thought that ‘Harp’ was just scratching the surface of 
D  what he can be.” 
D  <NO>Donaldson received 23 first-place votes. Los Angeles Angels 
D  outfielder Mike Trout got the other first-place votes finished 
D  second for the third time — he won the award last year. Kansas 
D  City outfielder Lorenzo Cain was third. 
D  [KERN-3]Donaldson led the AL with 123 RBIs and topped the majors 
D  by scoring 122 runs. He hit 41 home runs and batted .297.  He was 
D  traded from Oakland to Toronto last offseason<NO1>, Donaldson 
D  joined a power-packed lineup that included Jose Bautista and Edwin 
D  Encarnacion<NO>.<NO1> The Blue Jays battered their way to the AL 
D  East title and led the majors in runs and homers, with Donaldson 
D  leading the way.<NO> 
D  [/KERN-3]<NO1>“I feel like I was able to take advantage of the 
D  opportunities put in front of me,” Donaldson said on the MLB 
D  Network telecast of the awards. 
D  Donaldson joined George Bell (1987) as the only Toronto players to 
D  win the MVP. 
D  <NO>[SUBHED_1]Astros-Brewers swap 
D  [/SUBHED_1]The Astros traded infielder Jonathan Villar to the 
D  Milwaukee Brewers for minor-league righthander Cy Sneed. 
D  Villar, 24, hit. 284 with seven doubles, two homers and 11 RBIs in 
D  53 games for the Astros last season. Sneed had a 2.58 ERA in 23 
D  starts and three relief appearances for two single-A teams.
D  [SUBHED_1]The 2016 schedule
D  [/SUBHED_1]<WC1>The champion Kansas City Royals will host the New 
D  York Mets in a World Series rematch when the 2016 Major League 
D  Baseball season starts in April with three Sunday openers. Next 
D  year’s schedule also includes two games in Puerto Rico between 
D  Pittsburgh and Miami. MLB made the announcement Thursday. The St. 
D  Louis Cardinals will visit Pittsburgh in the first game of the 
D  year. 
D  <NO1>The Pirates and Marlins will play May 30-31 in San Juan. They 
D  will celebrate Roberto Clemente Day, a league-wide tribute 
D  honoring the late Pirates Hall of Famer who was born and raised on 
D  the island. 
D  The matchup at Hiram Bithorn Stadium will count as Marlins’ home 
D  games. They will be MLB’s first games in Puerto Rico since the 
D  Marlins and Mets played in 2010. 
D  The season starts April 3 with three games: Cardinals at Pirates, 
D  followed by Toronto at Tampa Bay and then the Mets visiting Kansas 
D  City at night. 
D  For the second straight year, all games played on the last day of 
D  the season — Oct. 2 — will start at approximately 3 p.m. EDT.

D  repeat
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Kate Harman
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]FOR THE INQUIRER
D  [/BYCREDIT]Casey Kilchrist is matter-of-fact about it.
D  “Last year, I didn’t score much,” the Villa Joseph Marie soccer 
D  player said. 
D  Four times, to be exact. 
D  Conversely, it seemed like all Murphy Agnew did was put the ball 
D  in the back of the net for the Jems, as she notched 36 goals in 
D  2014.
D  Scoring goals is a big part of the job for the junior forwards.
D  While Kilchrist would have liked to put more away in 2014, the 
D  pairing up top developed an undeniable chemistry. A chemistry 
D  first fostered as freshmen for VJM and on Yardley Makefield Soccer 
D  Club.
D  Together, the two became extremely dangerous propelling the 
D  attack.
D  As Agnew put it, “Everything just clicked for us.”
D  It’s still clicking for the formidable duo. Flash forward to this 
D  year and they have combined for 31 goals, with Kilchrist netting 
D  16 and Agnew 15.
D  The Jems (18-4) will try to defend their PIAA Class AA state 
D  championship on Saturday against District 10’s Villa Maria, 11 
D  a.m., at Hersheypark Stadium.
D  “Casey is a lot tougher than I am,” Agnew said. “She goes in and 
D  gets balls I can’t get to. She complements me very well.”
D  As for the Harvard recruit?
D  “She’s a game-changer,” Kilchrist said of Agnew. The speedy, 
D  dynamic and creative playmaker sure is, which is why it was such a 
D  gut check for VJM when she went down in the middle of a game with 
D  a back injury.
D  [KERN-2]“Losing one of your best players is hard. We didn’t know 
D  what to do,” Kilchrist said. “She got hurt in the middle of the 
D  Gwynedd game. It’s not like we could stop the game and figure out 
D  a game plan.”
D  [/KERN-2]Agnew’s back has been bothering her for the majority of 
D  the season, and she has had to practice and play through the pain 
D  in most cases. She sat out a couple of contests and played 
D  sparingly in a few more.
D  Who was going to fill the void in Agnew’s absence? Kilchrist, no 
D  doubt.
D  “It was just implied,” Agnew said. “She’s been playing fantastic.”
D  
D  So fantastic, in fact, that at one point, Kilchrist scored in 
D  eight straight games.
D  “To play the same team as last year, it is going to be tough, 
D  because they are going to be out for revenge,” Agnew said. “They 
D  are going to be looking to beat us.”
D  The last time the Jems were in Hershey, the team captured the 
D  program’s 10th state crown.
D  In that game, Kilchrist scored the game-winner. That was back when 
D  she wasn’t scoring “much.”
D  Imagine what she can do now.

D  Marple Newtown, throwing for 5,897 yards and 53 touchdowns from 
D  1993 to 1995.
D  [KERN-2]After going to Villanova on a scholarship, the Broomall 
D  native transferred to Shippensburg and passed for 6,325 yards and 
D  65 touchdowns in three seasons. That was followed by a brief stint 
D  in the Arena Football League II.
D  [/KERN-2]Following in the footsteps of his father, Harry, Gicking 
D  spent 13 years as an assistant at Conestoga. Things came full 
D  circle when he took over at Marple Newtown last year following Ray 
D  Gionta’s move to Sun Valley.
D  “It was something I had thought about doing for a long time,” said 
D  Gicking, also the school’s athletic director and dean of students. 
D  “It probably goes back to the time when I was playing here.”
D  In his second season, Gicking has guided the Tigers to a 9-2 
D  record and a berth in the District 1 Class AAA semifinals. Last 
D  week’s 20-7 triumph at Pottsgrove marked the first playoff win in 
D  program history.
D  [KERN-2]“You come into every season hoping to be successful,” 
D  Marple Newtown senior two-way end Noah Turner said. “But I think 
D  we had high expectations for this year because of the guys we had 
D  coming back.”
D  [/KERN-2]The sixth-seeded Tigers look to continue their banner 
D  campaign when they visit second-seeded Upper Moreland (9-2) at 7 
D  p.m. Friday.
D  [KERN-2]With the multiple hats he wears at the school, Gicking 
D  made it a point to thank his wife, Donna, for her support. The 
D  couple has three children: Olivia, 6; Christopher, 4; and Nolan, 
D  1. 
D  [/KERN-2]Gicking and his players had heavy hearts going into the 
D  playoff vs. Pottsgrove. Sophomore running back Jack Fallows’ 
D  father, Joe, 49, died earlier Friday at the Hospital of the 
D  University of Pennsylvania of complications from a stroke.
D  “Mr. Fallows was one of our biggest supporters,” senior captain 
D  Abel Hoff said. “He was part of the booster club, would come to a 
D  lot of our practices, and was there for every game.”
D  An all-purpose threat in the squad’s spread offense, the 5-foot-8, 
D  165-pound Hoff has made 64 catches for 1,010 yards and 10 TDs. He 
D  has rushed 95 times for 474 yards and six touchdowns.
D  “He has a terrific burst,” Gicking said of the third-year starter, 
D  who has a scholarship offer from Millersville and has drawn 
D  interest from Delaware, Lehigh, and Stony Brook, among others.
D  Hoff is supported on offense by QB Anthony Paoletti (1,664 yards 
D  passing, 14 TDs), running backs Fallows and Marlon<NO1>cq<NO> 
D  Weathers, and receivers Marcus Weathers, Chris Rufo<NO1>cq<NO>, 
D  and Tyler Kostack. <TB>
D  Harry Gicking, who came over with his son from Conestoga, is 
D  Marple Newtown’s defensive coordinator. “He’s very particular,” 
D  Chris Gicking said with a laugh. “Everything has to be perfect.”
D  In addition to Turner, a 6-2, 225-pounder who has notched eight 
D  sacks, the Tigers’ 4-4 defense is headed by fellow end Matt 
D  Trainor<NO1>cq<NO>, tackle Justin McKeown, linebacker Gino 
D  DiCamillo (76 tackles), and cornerbacks Hoff and Kostack.
D  Of Chris Gicking, Turner said, “He’s a great guy, always 
D  energetic, and a person you can turn to if you have a problem.”

D  
D  But back to Sansom Street. The seven-story Warwick apartment 
D  house, built in 1[KERN-2]903, and the Oliver Bair funeral home, 
D  from 1910, are protected because they’re part of the 
D  Rittenhouse-Fitler historic district. But the coffee shop, which 
D  began life as an ordinary rowhouse in 1855, is considered 
D  significant because of the elaborate tile facade it received in 
D  the ’20s. All are now in poor condition, according to the 
D  engineering report from Keast & Hood included in the hardship 
D  application. 
D  [/KERN-2]They didn’t get that way by accident. 
D  The trio fell into near-ruin under the ownership of a public 
D  agency, the Philadelphia Parking Authority. The authority acquired 
D  the buildings in 1997 (when the Warwick still had tenants) and sat 
D  on them for a decade in the hope of building — wait for it — a 
D  parking garage on Rittenhouse Square. The Historical Commission 
D  became the authority’s enabler when it approved the demolitions in 
D  “the public interest.” 
D  [KERN-3]Fortunately, Common Pleas Court overturned the 
D  commission’s action, saving the buildings and sparing Rittenhouse 
D  Square the indignity of a large garage on its doorstep. [/KERN-3]
D  <NO1>nu<NO>That was 2007, just as the big recession was setting 
D  in. The properties sat vacant for eight more years, until the 
D  assemblage was acquired this year by Southern Land for $30<TH>
D  million. 
D  <NO1>nu<NO>[KERN-2]Now the company says fixing the buildings would 
D  be a financial burden. Sound familiar? The Boyd’s owner made the 
D  same argument after buying the theater. The Boyd hardship decision 
D  sent a clear message about the city’s preference for development 
D  over preservation: Buy it, and you can demolish. [/KERN-2]
D  <NO1>nu<NO>[KERN-3]Southern Land’s chief, Tim Downey, acknowledged 
D  in an interview that he never took time to check the condition 
D  before the purchase. Because the historic buildings aren’t in the 
D  way of the tower Southern Land wants to build, he figured he would 
D  incorporate them into the project[/KERN-3]. 
D  <NO1>nu<NO>Once fixed up, they could have housed shops on the 
D  ground floor, apartments or offices above. That would have 
D  dovetailed perfectly with Pearl Properties’ new design for the 
D  Boyd Tower. Designed by Cecil Baker + Partners, it does a terrific 
D  job of reestablishing activity on Sansom Street. The complex 
D  project includes a midrise apartment building on the north side of 
D  Sansom that will be lined with ground-floor retail.
D  <NO1>nu<NO>Apart from the proposed demolitions, Southern Land’s 
D  development has a lot to recommend it. Construction on the empty 
D  lot facing Rittenhouse Square is long overdue, and Downey has 
D  hired a credible architect, Chicago’s Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz, 
D  which designed Market Street’s Murano. Unlike the Parking 
D  Authority, he’s smart enough to know that Rittenhouse Square 
D  deserves better than a garage. He plans condos, rental apartments, 
D  retail, and underground parking. Why not? It’s a can’t-lose 
D  location that promises big profit.<NO1>cq-sing.<NO> 
D  <NO1>nu<NO>But to do all that, Downey is going to need a zoning 
D  change to exceed the site’s height limit, as well as permission to 
D  close a portion of Moravian Street.
D  That’s a lot of “asks.” How about a “give”? If Southern Land 
D  doesn’t want to spend its own money to renovate the historic 
D  buildings, how about giving them to Project HOME for affordable 
D  housing? 
D  Southern Land would get the tax write-off. The city would preserve 
D  a pocket of affordability in an increasingly pricey neighborhood. 
D  Philadelphia’s historic buildings would get the respect they 
D  deserve. 
D  And then we might live up to our new status as a World Heritage 
D  City.

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]CHICAGO TRIBUNE
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]F[/DROP3]or Katie Silberman, the turning point 
D  came when a house painter accidentally ripped out the TV cables. 
D  Silberman and her husband, never big TV fans, had fallen into the 
D  habit of letting their sons, Lincoln, then 7, and Haven, 4, watch 
D  television. Now, with the electronic box quiet at last, they saw a 
D  chance for a fresh start. They told the kids they were going to go 
D  outside, play more<WC>,<WC1> and try new things. 
D  “We literally put the TV on the curb, and that was it,” says 
D  Silberman, 44, of Providence, R.I. “We didn’t want it anymore. It 
D  wasn’t this great moral epiphany. It just went off, and we were 
D  like, <WC>‘<WC1>God<WC>,<NO1><WC1>!<NO><WC> <WC1>this is super<NO1>
D  -<NO><WC> <WC1>nice.’<WC><TH><WC1>” 
D  Some parents <WC>who choose a low-tech life get there because 
D  they’ve reached<WC1> tipping points; others start their children 
D  on the screen-free diet recommended for kids under 2 (endorsed by 
D  the American Academy of Pediatrics) and see no reason to add lots 
D  of shows, apps<WC>,<WC1> and games to the menu. Some prohibit all 
D  TV, video games<WC>,<WC1> and nonacademic computer use on 
D  weekdays, but allow a few hours of screen time on weekends. <WC>
D  Maybe they allow it during winter but ban it over summer.
D  <WC1>Still, <WC>among five parents of kids 10 and younger 
D  interviewed for this article, <WC1>all stressed the importance of 
D  childhood play and a concern that TVs, computers, iPads<WC>,<WC1> 
D  and cellphones can distract kids from more rewarding childhood 
D  pursuits, such as<WC> <WC1>let’s-pretend, wandering in the 
D  woods<WC>,<WC1> and building with blocks. 
D  <NO1>there were common themes. In interviews with five parents of 
D  kids 10 and younger from cities as diverse as San Diego; 
D  Birmingham, Ala., and Tampa, Fla., all stressed the importance of 
D  childhood play and a concern that TVs, computers, iPads and 
D  cellphones can distract kids from more rewarding childhood 
D  pursuits, such as let’s-pretend, wandering in the woods and 
D  building with blocks. 
D  <NO>“It’s been amazing,” Silberman, a community liaison at Brown 
D  University, says two years after jettisoning her TV. “I have two 
D  boys, and they come home, and they play<WC>.<NO1><WC1>!<NO><WC> 
D  <WC1>They color, and they build Legos. They build crazy things out 
D  of cardboard. I don’t know how to put it. It’s just that it’s so 
D  much nicer this way. They’re so happy.” 
D  James Damude, a university chaplain in Midland, Mich., with four 
D  kids ages 2 to 9, says he and his wife made summer screen-free two 
D  years ago when their kids kicked off the season by asking, “Can we 
D  watch TV?” 
D  “This was the wildest thing: They played together so much better,” 
D  he says. “I would come into the living room, and they would all be 
D  sitting on the couch reading a book together — nobody was 
D  wrestling. They would go on bike rides around the block. My son’s 
D  got one of those little bike trailers he hooks up to his bike<NO1>
D  ,<NO><WC> <WC1>so he can do his paper route, and he would put the 
D  little kids in there and take them for bike rides. It seemed like 
D  they were more friendly, more sociable with each other. It’s not a 
D  scientific study, but they came alive, if you will, for those 
D  months.” 
D  Many parents start out wanting to aggressively limit screen time, 
D  according to psychologist Catherine Steiner-Adair, author of 
D  [ITALIC]The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family 
D  Relationships in the Digital Age[/ITALIC] (Harper). But in an era 
D  when a 2010 survey by Common Sense Media indicates the <WC>typical 
D  <WC1>5- to 8-year-old gets <WC>two<NO1><WC1>2<NO><WC> <WC1>hours 
D  and 21 minutes of screen time per day, it can be incredibly 
D  difficult to stay the course. 
D  Still, she says, some parents do manage. 
D  “Everywhere I go, I meet parents who say, <WC>‘<WC1>You know what? 
D  It’s kind of lonely, but we’re not giving our child a smartphone; 
D  our child has a flip phone,’<WC><TH><WC1>” Steiner-Adair says. <WC>
D  “<TH>‘<WC1>We don’t let our child play computer games. We don’t 
D  have a Wii. We don’t have any of that; we’re a very low-tech 
D  family.’<WC><TH><WC1>” 
D  <NO1>It’s unclear how many parents are severely limiting screen 
D  time. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, which helped 
D  locate most of the parents interviewed for this story, was able to 
D  quickly identify more than two dozen families. 
D  <NO>Adeline and Alice Habgood, ages 8 and 5, don’t get screen time 
D  during the week<WC>,<WC1> and <WC>they <WC1>watch about two hours 
D  of Netflix on weekends. Their mother, Katie, 38, a city planner in 
D  Tampa, Fla., says the girls recently made fairy houses out of shoe 
D  boxes. They read, color<WC>,<WC1> and invent elaborate 
D  make-believe games that last for days. 
D  [KERN+2]“One of our favorite things is to play vet,” says Adeline. 
D  “We like to pretend we work at a humane society. We have a vest 
D  that we use, and we have a little thing that’s a shot, and we have 
D  a whiteboard, and we’ll pretend we’re open 24 hours a day, and 
D  we’ll take the animals, and our dad has lots of Ace bandages, so 
D  we’ll wrap up their legs.” 
D  <WC>On the downside, a TV ban might mean kids won’t be <WC1>able 
D  to share in conversations with peers about TV shows or popular 
D  music. 
D  [/KERN+2]Keri Lane Hontzas, an event marketer in Birmingham, Ala., 
D  says that when a stuffed<WC>-<WC1>animal website was popular in 
D  third grade, her daughter felt she was the only one not 
D  participating. 
D  “Well, maybe so,” Hontzas says she told her, “but we’re always 
D  doing something on the weekend. We’re going hiking, or we’re going 
D  biking. You’re going to enjoy that more in the long run.” 
D  <NO1>How much do parents have to limit screen time to see benefits 
D  such as an increase in imaginative play? 
D  The answer varies from child to child and family to family; some 
D  kids can get off the computer easily, and some really can’t, 
D  Steiner-Adair says. Some families allow no screen time on weekdays 
D  but then give grade schoolers a chance for extended play with a 
D  constructive game such as Minecraft on the weekends. Other 
D  families say that, after kids have played outside and done their 
D  homework, they can have a half-hour of computer time before 
D  dinner. 
D  “I myself don’t see the need for two hours a day” of screen time, 
D  Steiner-Adair says. “And you have to be really thoughtful about 
D  what your child is doing during that time.” 
D  <NO>The American Academy of Pediatrics offers additional 
D  information and resources for handling your children’s media use. 
D  Among its tips: 
D  Establish “screen-free” zones at home. Remove televisions, 
D  computers<WC>,<WC1> and video games from children’s bedrooms. 
D  Turn off the TV during dinner. 
D  Limit children’s and teens’ engagement with entertainment media to 
D  one to two hours per day. Make sure it is high-quality content. 
D  <NO1>Go to www.aap.org (type “children and media” in the search 
D  field) for more details.

D  First name or last, whatever goes on the birth certificate always 
D  involves a considerable amount of discussion. 
D  Some millennial moms are opting, if they do take their husband’s 
D  name, to give their last name as a first name to baby.

D  <NO1>Friday November 13, 2015. ( DAVID SWANSON / Staff

D  November 13, 2015. ( DAVID SWANSON / Staff Photographer )

D  Philadelphia was admitted into a very exclusive club earlier this 
D  month, the Organization of World Heritage Cities, and it has been 
D  basking in the glow ever since. But being a World Heritage City 
D  should not be confused with being a city concerned about its 
D  heritage.
D  The last few years have been disastrous for Philadelphia’s 
D  architectural patrimony. Grand stone churches are falling like 
D  autumn leaves. This week it was a stately sanctuary on 12th Street 
D  where the barrier-busting singer Marian Anderson gave her first 
D  performances. The city’s stock of notable buildings is being 
D  steadily eroded by neglect, indifference and, especially, the 
D  housing boom, with its insatiable appetite for buildable lots. 
D  The Nutter Administration hasn’t exactly gone out of its way to 
D  stabilize the situation. During the last eight years, a paltry 64 
D  properties were added to the city’s historic register. Not that 
D  the protected ones have fared so well. We’ve just lost two 
D  landmarked theaters, the Boyd and the Royal, to developers who 
D  were able to exploit the Historical Commission’s financial 
D  hardship excemption.
D  That loophole has become a favorite tactic for developers who just 
D  happen to find themselves with historic buildings that require 
D  costly repairs. Even as city officials celebrated the public 
D  relations coup of the World Heritage designation, another 
D  developer was filing for hardship. 
D  This time, the target isn’t a cultural extrovert like the Boyd, 
D  but three lesser-known structures that provide the backdrop to our 
D  daily travels through the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood: an 
D  exuberantly decorated coffee shop, an early apartment house, and a 
D  funeral home. The trio — located across Sansom Street from what 
D  used to be the Boyd auditorium — sit at the edge of an acre-size 
D  empty lot owned by Southern Land Company, which plans a <NO>
D  development fronting Rittenhouse Square.

D  options for a Victorian house
D  <NO>[/WEBHEAD][WEBTAGS]<NO1>home_design,lifestyle,inqlifestyle
D  <NO>[/WEBTAGS][BOLD]Q: [/BOLD]I am a new owner of a Queen 
D  An[KERN-3]ne Victorian. Although the furniture is Victorian, I do 
D  not want to use Victorian window coverings because the house has 
D  its original wavy glass windows and newly restored window 
D  surrounds. The windows are double hung, and only the bottom half 
D  would need to be covered at night for privacy. Any ideas would be 
D  greatly appreciated.
D  [/KERN-3][SIGNATURE]<QM>— L.B.
D  [/SIGNATURE][BOLD]A:[/BOLD] This [KERN+3]sounds like a fun 
D  project. And there is no reason you have to stay true to the heavy 
D  Victorian style for your window treatments. As you probably know, 
D  the original style was often dramatic and fussy layered window 
D  treatments that not only blocked all the light, but also hid the 
D  beautiful woodwork.
D  [/KERN+3]You are fortunate to need only a little privacy at night. 
D  With that in mind, you could try another classic Victorian 
D  treatment: Use interior wood shutters or blinds that match your 
D  woodwork in a way that ties in with the architecture of your 
D  house. 
D  Most Victorian houses have small windows. Choose a small-scale 
D  shutter with hinges that allow you to open fully for maximized 
D  light, to enjoy the wavy glass, and to operate the window<NO1> 
D  itself<NO>. 
D  Shades made of natural materials or fabric mounted midway may be 
D  another solution if you don’t mind the look of the mounting 
D  hardware or having a roll of material across the center of your 
D  window.
D  Reverse blinds or shades that stack on the sill might work, too, 
D  but only if you have deep sills — and that’s probably not the case 
D  for a true Victorian house with original windows. Plus, I’d rather 
D  see the beautiful wood sill than a stack of fabric.
D  Let me know how it goes, and send me a picture when you’re 
D  finished.

D  timpane edit and cq<NO>[BYLINE]By John Timpane
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]A[/DROP3]dele’s new album, titled [ITALIC]
D  25[/ITALIC] (ColumbiaAdvance [REVIEW_LIGHT]<SC8,105><SC8,105>
D  <SC8,105>[/REVIEW_LIGHT]) is … wait for it … drum roll … everyone 
D  listening? … very good, a deserving follow-up to [ITALIC]
D  21,[/ITALIC] one of the greatest-selling albums of all time. There 
D  must have been overwhelming pressure on Adele, already 27, to give 
D  an adoring world something to keep up the adoration. She responds 
D  confidently and in full voice, with a coherent concept, sustained 
D  bouts of excellent songwriting, and brave singing against some of 
D  the best production your ears can find.
D  She and [ITALIC]25[/ITALIC] do too much of the same thing a little 
D  too often. But it’s likely not to matter to the people who bought 
D  [ITALIC]19[/ITALIC] and [ITALIC]21[/ITALIC] (28-30 million).
D  “Hello” kicks it off, and it is brilliant, a classic as soon as it 
D  dropped. Everyone on the streets seems to be singing it. Dramatic, 
D  opening chords, those trademark Adele background vocals, and a 
D  pulsing chorus that is as black as it is blue. She reflects on the 
D  “million miles between us,” the tumultuous changes year by year in 
D  your 20s. Incredibly brave singing. You could hardly ask for a 
D  better opener.
D  Then comes “Send My Love,” stripping down to a single guitar 
D  ostinato, a very wise choice. (One complaint is that, as the album 
D  wears on, there’s too much tsunami-of-sound, full-in-the-face, 
D  late-era-Barry-Manilow-drums stuff. Adele can do this only so 
D  much, and she does it slightly too much.) “We both know we ain’t 
D  kids no more,” she sings, driving home this album’s message: Time 
D  passes, we don’t stay the same, and we hope against hope that love 
D  will comfort us.
D  Back to whomping drums on “I Miss You.” It’s another piece of 
D  excellent songcraft. “I want to step into your great unknown” is 
D  one of many telling lines in this album; Adele is well known as 
D  and should be better known as a fine lyricist. I’d say it’s too 
D  [ITALIC]25[TEXT] — except it’s so committed, so resolute. S[/TEXT]
D  [/ITALIC]he’s not breaking up; she’s wondering what, if anything, 
D  is next.
D  The central tune might well be “When We Were Young.” She tells the 
D  beloved, “You look like a movie and sound like a song,” still, 
D  just as you used to. “Let me photograph you in this light / in 
D  case it is the last time that we might be / exactly like we were 
D  before we realized” we can’t stay the same. It’s fear of aging, of 
D  losing the perspective of 19 and 25. Believe me, many millions 
D  will hear these lines and nod: “I so know.” She isn’t where she 
D  used to be and will never be again. More reckless singing, with 
D  one memorable, stratospheric note.
D  “Remedy” takes the theme and kicks it forward: “I remember all of 
D  the things I thought I wanted to be.” This sounds different, a 
D  sprightly waltz with piano. That’s all it is, voice and piano, and 
D  that, in a frequently dark, crashing album, is welcome. Delivered 
D  with total assurance. People can comfort one another through the 
D  pain and being urged into future selves. It’s a moving, worthy 
D  exploration for all ages.
D  “Water Under the Bridge” may well be a future single. Another 
D  welcome change-up, with a gentle dance beat. It gets a little 
D  Euro-celestial for me, but a lot of people will love this track. 
D  Adele has long been a leader, with original lead-chorus 
D  interactions, and that brilliance is on display here.
D  “River Lea” is the last real standout until the end. Adele grew up 
D  in Tottenham, where the Lea does flow, and she ponders the paradox 
D  of being rooted (the river is “in my roots, in my veins, in my 
D  blood”) yet being carried forward. She can’t go back, but she’s 
D  also always there.
D  And then, well … “Love in the Dark,” not the strongest song. 
D  “Million Years Ago” has an interesting Jobim-era samba sound, but 
D  retreads much-treaded ground, alas. “All I Ask” is similarly 
D  undistinguished, except for a single, searing line: Let’s “play 
D  pretend we’re not scared of what is coming next.”
D  “Sweetest Devotion” is the most cheerful moment on this album, a 
D  sweet verse to a swingin’ six, a woo-hoo chorus, a promise of 
D  commitment. Forward! To 28 … 29 … and … ulp … 30? It ends with the 
D  one bit of fun here, a baby’s voice, perhaps Adele’s 3-year-old, 
D  Angelo. [ITALIC]Devotion[/ITALIC] is the last word, because it has 
D  to be. 
D  Adele is Adele, and this is no [ITALIC]25[/ITALIC]. But it’s 
D  worthy.

D  <NO>[/WEBTAGS]By Peter Dobrin
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER MUSIC CRITIC[/BYCREDIT]
D  [DROP3]W[/DROP3]hether Schumann said it elsewhere with greater 
D  clarity or more punch grew unimportant Wednesday<NO1>18<NO> night 
D  when the Elias String Quartet played his [ITALIC]String Quartet in 
D  F Major, Op. 41, No. 2[/ITALIC]. The piece can be trying. But the 
D  point is, the playing was so exquisitely worked out and rendered 
D  with such love that it probably will never attract a better guide 
D  to its oddly special qualities.
D  If talking about love in the realm of string quartets[KERN-2] 
D  seems arbitrary, consider the full achievement of the Elias’ 
D  Philadelphia Chamber Music Society appearance at the Perelman 
D  Theater. In Schumann, Haydn, and Beethoven, devotion to a 
D  collective sound and soul of a piece was scrupulously observed, 
D  but as an act of striking modesty. When a figure in the Schumann 
D  got passed from one player to the next, pitch and timbre 
D  differences were nonexistent. Cellist Marie Bitlloch’s pizzicato 
D  and violinist Sara Bitlloch’s melody bent in time with what can 
D  only be described as a clairvoyant understanding. This is real 
D  quartet playing.
D  [/KERN-2]Collective strengths, however, by no means existed to 
D  mask individual weaknesses. The London-based Elias boasts a 
D  foursome of absolute equals: expressively adventurous violinists 
D  Sara Bitlloch (who happens to be a Curtis graduate) and Donald 
D  Grant, and the velvety ideal shared by violist Martin Saving and 
D  cellist Marie Bitlloch.
D  A variety of musical temperaments emerged in startling detail. 
D  They found humor in Haydn’s[ITALIC] String Quartet in C Major, Op. 
D  54, No. 2[/ITALIC] by isolating its opening gestures. Sara 
D  Bitlloch liberated the first violin melodies of the second 
D  movement by giving them an improvised feel. The group highlighted 
D  the best in the Schumann, a first movement full of coy sighs and, 
D  rare to this composer, carefree thoughts.
D  Beethoven’s [ITALIC]String Quartet in C Major, Op. 59, No. 3, 
D  “Razumovsky,”[/ITALIC] came with a minor struggle or two — the 
D  final fugato is almost there — but, really, these moments mattered 
D  not at all. Musical values showed something much bigger. The 
D  second movement’s forte-piano accents came like small jolts, 
D  slightly suspending time. Grant and Saving rendered their 
D  third-movement runs as a series of astonishingly quick, yet finely 
D  wrought, strands. Voices ducked in and out and technique calmed 
D  challenge, but the Elias remained, in every way, a single stunning 
D  organism.

D  does the run of the entire show, since it's about to end -- with 
D  the new episode ``Finale Part 1: The Girl Who Made a Splash,'' as 
D  the last runway show awaits. There's backstage trouble, though,

D  presentation. Host Tyra Banks also remains one of the judges. 
D  (N)10 p.m. (Ch. 3) Blue Bloods Diane Neal can't get away from 
D  playing New York-based prosecutors -- on ``Law & Order: Special

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]A great weekend for runners — and watchers
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Natalie Pompilio
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]FOR THE INQUIRER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP5]Two types of people will flood Philadelphia this 
D  weekend: elite runners and the people who support them. Both can 
D  have a great time at the 22d Gore-Tex Philadelphia Marathon and 
D  Half Marathon — with the right planning.
D  [/DROP5]It’s easier for the more than 25,000 runners. They’ll 
D  enjoy a scenic course Sunday — either a full 26.2 miles or a 
D  slightly more reasonable (ha<NO1>!<NO>) 13.1 miles — that passes 
D  through such neighborhoods<NO1>,<NO> as Chinatown, Society Hill, 
D  University City, and Manayunk. They’ll be welcomed at the start 
D  line, celebrated at the finish, and applauded and inspired by the 
D  crowds at “cheer zones” throughout the course. 
D  The expected 60,000 spectators can cheer on their fleet-footed 
D  friends while also having a good time all their own. Fitness fans 
D  may choose to do a [ITALIC]Rocky[/ITALIC]-esque run up the steps 
D  of the Philadelphia Museum of Art<NO1> Museum<NO>, or<NO1> to<NO> 
D  strap on skates for a quick loop around the Rothman Institute Ice 
D  Rink at Dilworth Park. History hounds will find cheering points 
D  conveniently located near some of the city’s most popular 
D  attractions, including Independence Hall and the National 
D  Constitution Center. Those with more leisurely leanings will find 
D  plenty of eating, drinking, shopping, and sightseeing to fill the 
D  hours.
D  “Marathon weekend is special even if you’re a nonrunner,” said 
D  Mark Sullivan of Freeburg<NO1>cq Freesburg<NO>, <NO1>Pa.,<NO>
D  Snyder County, one of only two people<NO1> OTHER GUY BELOW<NO> who 
D  has run in every Philadelphia Marathon since its 1994 inaugural. 
D  “The city offers so much. There’s something for everyone.”
D  While the city has hosted an annual 26.2-mile race since 1954, the 
D  modern history of the Gore-Tex Philadelphia Marathon begins in 
D  <NO1>1994<NO>mid-1990s, when the city took over race management 
D  and designed a course entirely within city limits. There were 
D  1,500 runners in that first marathon; the half-marathon was added 
D  in 2006. The Gore-Tex Philadelphia Marathon is one of the 10 
D  largest races of its kind in the country and is a U<NO1>.<NO>S<NO1>
D  .<NO>A<NO1>.<NO> Track & Field-sanctioned event.
D  The marathon-based programing begins Friday with the Comcast 
D  Health & Fitness Expo at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. This 
D  free event, which is also open Saturday, is for athletes and couch 
D  potatoes alike and offers lectures and presentations on healthy 
D  topics, shopping, and exhibits, and has<NO1>add<NO> a dedicated 
D  area for children. Bob Koen, the only other person to run in every 
D  race since 1994, says he picks up his race number at the expo, 
D  then strolls around downtown.
D  “I love Philadelphia,” said Koen, of Audubon, N.J., who said that 
D  his son-in-law would also be running this year and that his 
D  daughter would be cheering them both on. “I like a lot of noise,” 
D  he said. “When you’re running and there are a lot of people, it 
D  really gets you charged up.”
D  Daytime Saturday will bring the annual Rothman Institute 8K and a 
D  Kids Fun Run that offers mile- and half-mile options. Saturday 
D  night will see carb-loading runners filling up restaurants 
D  throughout the area. (Sullivan, for example, will probably be at 
D  the Center City Maggiano’s.) 
D  While there is no continual television broadcast of the race 
D  Sunday, the course is very spectator-friendly, Sullivan said. 
D  Downtown, for example, spectators can see the runners at three 
D  locations within easy walking distance of each other. 
D  While there’s a buzz and energy near the race’s start line on the 
D  Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Sullivan said, he doesn’t recommend it 
D  as a vantage point if you’re there to support an individual 
D  runner.
D  “You can only get so close, and they get lost in the crowd. It’s a 
D  bunch of heads bobbing off into the distance.”
D  Instead, he recommends Logan Circle or a spot near City Hall, 
D  perhaps Broad and Arch Streets, as a good starting vantage point. 
D  From there, spectators can walk to Chestnut Street and catch their 
D  runners anywhere along that two-mile stretch. A quick hop back to 
D  the Art Museum allows watchers to see their runners at the halfway 
D  point.
D  “The runners will have thinned out,” he said, “and you can see 
D  your person, toss them a shirt or a fresh pair of gloves.” 
D  Other great p<CW-24>laces to cheer, Sullivan said, include 
D  Manayunk, which is always crowded with supporters, and near the 
D  Philadelphia Zoo, which offers a chance to amuse restless children 
D  while also supporting racers. 
D  </CW>Can’t make any of those locations? No problem, Sullivan said. 
D  You can’t buy a bad ticket for this show. In fact, you can’t buy a 
D  ticket at all. 
D  “This is an opportunity to watch a professional sporting event for 
D  free,” he said. “It’s citywide, and chances are there’s someplace 
D  near you where you can watch it.”
D  <NO1>The 22nd GORE-TEX Philadelphia Marathon will be held Sunday, 
D  Nov. 22. The programming begins Friday afternoon. For more
