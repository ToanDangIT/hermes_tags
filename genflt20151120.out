D  [/SUBHED14_2][FLUSH_LEFT]Though he’s the scion of a famous jazz 
D  family (his father was the legendary tenor saxophonist John and 
D  his mother the influential pianist Alice), post-bop saxophonist 
D  [BOLD]Ravi Coltrane[/BOLD] has forged a distinctive career in his 
D  own right. He displays his cerebral, sculptural style at Chris’ 
D  Jazz Cafe, 1421 Sansom St. Times: 8 and 10 p.m. Friday<NO1>

D  [FLUSH_LEFT]William O. Douglas was a political and legal 
D  celebrity, a rock star in his field way before that term had any 
D  meaning. After struggling to escape an impoverished youth in the 
D  great Northwest, he battled his way to becoming a lawyer, chair of 
D  the SEC, and prominent New Dealer (FDR considered him for the vice 
D  presidency in 1944). In 1939, he became a Supreme Court justice at 
D  age 40 and served for a record 36 years and 209 days. His devotion 
D  to civil liberties and environmentalism made him controversial, 
D  and a later predilection for marrying women several decades his 
D  junior made him notorious. Douglas Scott’s [BOLD]Mountain: The 
D  Journey of Justice Douglas[/BOLD] tries to fit it all in one 
D  drama. The show finishes its run at the Bristol Riverside Theatre, 
D  120 Radcliffe St., Bristol. Times: 8<TH>p.m. Friday<NO1>11/20<NO>,

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]<DC@1,3,41,0,0,0,0,0,2,88,100>The vintage Citroen 
D  driven by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in [ITALIC]By the 
D  Sea[/ITALIC] is an amazing vehicle.
D  </DC>It seems barely big enough to seat the two of them, but when 
D  they unload their bags at a seaside French resort, out come a 
D  billion hats, several months’ worth of fashionable clothes, even a 
D  typewriter.
D  [KERN-3]This defies belief, but maybe it’s another of 
D  writer-director Jolie’s purple metaphors — to say that she and 
D  Brad play a married couple with baggage is putting in mildly.
D  [/KERN-3]Roland (Pitt) is a famous American writer, but a blocked 
D  one. During their vacation, he sits at the local café smoking 
D  cigarettes and drinking too much, staring at his blank notepad.
D  That’s when he’s at his most appealing. At other times, he’s 
D  talking, armed with only the faux-’70s existentialist dialogue 
D  Jolie has provided.
D  “You want my advice?” says the bartender.
D  “Do I have a choice?” says Roland.
D  “Love her.”
D  Easier said than done. Wife Vanessa is a pill — rude, depressed, 
D  and alarmingly thin, a condition accented by the stupendously 
D  large sunglasses she wears under her leopard-print sun hat.
D  The shades are a portentous object in the film. When Vanessa isn’t 
D  hiding behind them, Jolie is showing us close-ups of the glasses 
D  as Roland and Vanessa carefully adjust them on the dresser.
D  [KERN-3]There is an insufferable hour of this before something 
D  interesting happens. Vanessa discovers a peephole that allows her 
D  to spy on the couple next door (Melanie Laurent, Melvil Poupaud). 
D  Soon, she and Roland are taking turns watching, as if looking in 
D  on a version of themselves before their marriage was weakened by 
D  The Unspeakable Thing That Happened. 
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-0]Jolie intends Roland and Vanessa to be 
D  mysterious, so she plops us into the movie with no backstory. She 
D  and Pitt, world-famous celebrities, have no chance to disappear 
D  into the roles. They don’t have time to be anything but Brad and 
D  Angelina.
D  [/KERN-0]Is this intentional? The Peeping Tom angle could be 
D  Jolie’s commentary on the voyeurism that defines and distorts her 
D  life. At one point, Vanessa and Roland enter the neighboring room, 
D  so the only people peeking are us.
D  Of course, I’m there as a hostage, not as a willing participant.
D  I spent the hours <NO1>(and the movie appears to have been 
D  shortened recently by 10 minutes)<NO> counting the times Jolie’s 
D  dialogue seemed to arrive in the form of a capsule review.
D  “Am I really this dull?”
D  “Dear Lord, that was painful.”
D  “Going through something horrible could make you stronger.”
D  By that standard, I could walk out of [ITALIC]By the Sea[/ITALIC] 
D  able to bench-press 500 pounds.

D  the line for Katniss and crew
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Steven Rea
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER MOVIE CRITIC
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]Katniss Everdeen can hang up her bow and arrow 
D  now and wipe away that look of sad, defiant rage.
D  With [/DROP3][ITALIC]The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2[/ITALIC]
D  , the final installment in the adventures of a valiant teen and 
D  her battle against decadent authority figures and the cynical 
D  puppetmasters of a deadly reality-TV spectacle, all the dystopian 
D  hooha comes to a crashing end.
D  A franchise that made Jennifer Lawrence a star and made something 
D  like $2.3<TH>billion at the global box office — not counting the 
D  chump change [ITALIC]Part 2 [/ITALIC]is poised to make — [ITALIC]
D  The Hunger Games[/ITALIC] wrapped its message of media 
D  manipulation and the commercialization of violence in an action 
D  fantasy with a courageous, independent woman as its star.
D  The premise was — is — creepy and thrilling at the same time. 
D  Adapting Suzanne Collins’ best-selling [ITALIC]Hunger 
D  Games[/ITALIC] trilogy (turned into a<NO1>, um, quadrilogy<NO> 
D  tetralogy for the benefit of Lionsgate shareholders), the 
D  filmmakers conjured up a postapocalyptic, despotic North American 
D  nation called Panem, where kids pursue kids in a televised [ITALIC]
D  Survivor[/ITALIC]-meets-[ITALIC]Gladiator[/ITALIC]-style death 
D  match. The victor of the annual bloodfest is turned celebrity, 
D  embarking on an elaborate road show, touring Panem’s 12 districts, 
D  and then getting to live out his or her life in pampered splendor.
D  
D  Meanwhile, at the Capitol, the 1<TH>percent stuff their faces with 
D  fancy food, parade around in gaudy couture, and genuflect at the 
D  feet of President Snow, played with an evil glower by Donald 
D  Sutherland.
D  We all know how 2012’s [ITALIC]The Hunger Games[/ITALIC] turned 
D  out (what, you don’t? — two victors instead of one, a revolt is 
D  born!), and in 2013’s [ITALIC]Catching Fire [/ITALIC]and last 
D  year’s [ITALIC]Mockingjay — Part 1, [/ITALIC]Lawrence’s Katniss 
D  was elevated to pop-star status, a symbol of rebellion as iconic 
D  and inspiring as Che Guevara. 
D  [ITALIC]Mockingjay — Part 2[/ITALIC] starts off just a gasping, 
D  rasping breath after [ITALIC]Part 1[/ITALIC]’s end, with Katniss 
D  bruised and broken, looking on at her District 12 sweetie, Peeta 
D  Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), now strapped to a hospital bed, having 
D  been turned against Katniss by means of “tracker jacker venom” — a 
D  mind-control drug administered by the Panem baddies (and sometimes 
D  available as the surprise in Cracker Jack<NO1>s<NO> boxes).
D  If [ITALIC]Mockingjay — Part 1[/ITALIC] was walkier and talkier 
D  than its forerunners, [ITALIC]Part 2[/ITALIC] is pretty much all 
D  action — and lesser for it. 
D  <CW-7>It doesn’t take long for Katniss to get her voice back and 
D  join a “propo” squad — a troop of rebels, in black SWAT gear, that 
D  skirts the front lines of the bloody civil war, shooting 
D  propaganda videos with Katniss as their star. Joining her is Gale 
D  Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), her childhood friend and hunting 
D  buddy. 
D  </CW><CW-13>When Peeta, still reeling from his brainwashing 
D  regime, is assigned to the unit, no one’s sure whether he can be 
D  trusted — and the blond highlights in Hutcherson’s hair make him 
D  especially suspect. There’s a love-triangle thing going on here: 
D  Katniss and Peeta, Katniss and Gale. Maybe she should consult with 
D  Bella Swan<NO1>n<NO> and see how that Team Edward/Team Jacob thing 
D  worked out.
D  </CW>Directed by Francis Lawrence (no relation to his star), 
D  [ITALIC]Part 2 [/ITALIC]offers a primer in how power corrupts and 
D  how absolute power corrupts absolutely. Not only is President Snow 
D  not to be trusted, but President Coin (Julianne Moore, with 
D  proclamations of shady nuance and streaks of white-gray hair) is 
D  no Miss Transparency herself.
D  Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died in February 2014, near the end of 
D  the film’s production, is back as head gamemaker Plutarch 
D  Heavensbee. He has a few scenes with Lawrence, and with Moore, 
D  that make you wonder what the chitchat was like between takes. 
D  Serious actors, these three, seriously fooling around in their 
D  [ITALIC]Hunger Games[/ITALIC] getups. R.I.P.
D  There are slimy reptilian mutants in [ITALIC]Mockingjay — Part 
D  2[/ITALIC], and there are scores of children in harm’s way. And 
D  there are a number of smart, tough females: Michelle Forbes as a 
D  rebel lieutenant who calls Katniss “soldier”; Jena Malone as the 
D  shrewd District 7 tribute; Moore’s Alma Coin, determined to make 
D  herself Coin of the realm.
D  For all the guts and glory these women display, the final scene of 
D  [ITALIC]The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2 [/ITALIC]— the final 
D  scene of [ITALIC]The Hunger Games[/ITALIC] saga — has got to be a 
D  comedown. It’d be a spoiler to go into, but this may be the first 
D  time in four movies where Lawrence’s expression doesn’t look at 
D  all convincing. 
D  This is no face for a girl on fire.

D  [ITALIC]Mockingjay — Part 1 [/ITALIC]was walkier and talkier than 
D  its forerunners, [ITALIC]Part 2 [/ITALIC]is pretty much all action 
D  — and lesser for it. Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss Everdeen and a 
D  “propo” squad work their way through the battle-scarred Capitol, 
D  as the final installment in the adventures of a valiant teen and 
D  her battle against decadent authority figures and cynical 
D  puppetmasters comes to a crashing end.[BOLD] PG-13 [/BOLD]

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT]<DC@1,3,41,0,0,0,0,0,2,88,100>In [ITALIC]The Night 
D  Before[/ITALIC], Seth Rogen attempts the first 
D  bros-before-ho-ho-ho’s comedy.
D  </DC>He plays Isaac, who tries, along with high-school buddies 
D  Chris (Anthony Mackie) and Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to 
D  maintain a fraying tradition of spending Christmas Eve together, 
D  though Isaac now has a family, and Chris is a famous pro athlete.
D  The odd dude out is Ethan, who has a botched music career and 
D  works on the fringes of the catering business, when he’s not alone 
D  in his apartment moping about his breakup with Diana (Lizzy 
D  Kaplan), who dated him for reasons that are never made clear.
D  Isaac has a pregnant wife (Jillian Bell) and new priorities; Chris 
D  has new celebrity friends. But they humor Ethan with one more 
D  night on the town, and he repays them by scoring invitations to an 
D  infamous holiday party known as the Nutcracker Ball.
D  Along the way, Isaac pukes in a church, and many F-bombs detonate, 
D  but [ITALIC]The Night Before[/ITALIC] is not the [ITALIC]Bad 
D  Santa[/ITALIC] anti-Yule black comedy promised by the TV ads.
D  It’s also not funny, at least not very often.
D  Most of the gags involve Isaac on an extended drug trip. Rogen 
D  stretches here, going from the pothead we know (and sometimes 
D  love) to a guy who also binges on cocaine, mushrooms, and other 
D  things I couldn’t identify because slang is used, and I no longer 
D  speak drug.
D  Mackie has little to do here, and Gordon-Levitt plays a simp — no 
D  job, no ambition, no personality. Ethan is the inert, charmless 
D  bum who gives bro comedies a bad name. Much hangs on whether he 
D  will meet his girlfriend’s parents. Why would they [ITALIC]
D  want[/ITALIC] to meet him?
D  [ITALIC]The Night Before[/ITALIC] bumps along in hit-or-miss 
D  fashion before finally locating the last refuge of the gag-starved 
D  comedy: celebrity cameos. These pay few dividends, but you do get 
D  laughs from Ilana Glazer in a small role. And Bell is always a 
D  welcome presence in a movie comedy. 
D  The one true standout, though, is Michael Shannon, making a rare 
D  comic turn as a pot-dealing angel, a character amusingly cribbed 
D  from [ITALIC]A Christmas Carol [/ITALIC]and [ITALIC]It’s a 
D  Wonderful Life[/ITALIC].
D  He gives our leads the marijuana of Christmas Past, Present, and 
D  Future.
D  All is calm.
D  All is bright.
D  If the studio is on the ball, I expect weed with [ITALIC]The Night 
D  Before[/ITALIC] label to be on sale this Christmas in Colorado.

D  <NO1>[WEBHEAD]‘Secret in Their Eyes’: Forget this senseless film 
D  noir
D  [/WEBHEAD][WEBTAGS]entertainment,movies,inqartsent
D  [/WEBTAGS]<NO>[BYLINE]By Steven Rea
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER MOVIE CRITIC
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]A flashbacking film noir adapted from 2010’s 
D  foreign-language Oscar winner,[/DROP3][ITALIC] Secret in Their 
D  Eyes[/ITALIC] is notable for its top-tier cast — Julia Roberts, 
D  Nicole Kidman, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are the leads — and for its 
D  utter lack of credulity and good sense.
D  Set in Los Angeles, in 2002 and again in 2015, this putative 
D  thriller, directed and written by Billy Ray (whose other credit 
D  this week is the screenplay for [ITALIC]The Hunger Games: 
D  Mockingjay — Part 2[/ITALIC]), turns on the rape and murder of a 
D  young woman. The body, soaked in bleach to erase evidence, is 
D  found in a Dumpster next to a mosque being watched over by the 
D  feds. It is the shaky, suspicious days after 9/11, and one of 
D  Ray’s augmentations of the original Argentine mystery is to muck 
D  things up with Patriot Act surveillance, paranoia, and intrigue.
D  The victim, alas, happens to be the bright-eyed teenage daughter 
D  of Roberts’ Jesse Cobb, a district attorney’s investigator. She 
D  and Ejiofor’s Ray Kasten, an FBI agent, are there when the corpse 
D  is discovered. There is a suspect (Joe Cole), and there is Agent 
D  Kasten’s certainty that he is the man, but because he’s a federal 
D  witness planted at the mosque where a terror cell is believed to 
D  operate, he’s allowed to go free. 
D  Kasten leaves the bureau to become a security consultant. Cobb 
D  continues at the D.A.’s Office, but the loss of her daughter has 
D  turned her pale, worried, and worn. (This may be Roberts’ least 
D  glammy role ever.)
D  As for Kidman, she’s Claire Sloane, deputy D.A. back when the body 
D  was found, and running things now, 13 years later, when Kasten 
D  walks in with a prison mug shot he thinks is the perp’s. Claire 
D  and Ray have some history together — they got their ID cards on 
D  the same day, and they’ve had a hankering for each other ever 
D  since. 
D  She’s Harvard Law, he’s City College, but, boy, do they like each 
D  other — you can tell by the yearning regret in his eyes, and by 
D  Claire’s strategically unbuttoned blouse and the way she sashays 
D  across a room. Kidman’s (and the director’s) idea of playing 
D  things seductively, provocatively, borders on Russ Meyer camp. (In 
D  fact, I think Kidman’s character was once a counselor at that 
D  camp.) 
D  <CW-18>The pair’s mutual attraction is cause for unintentional 
D  laughs; more guffaws are forthcoming when director Ray stages two 
D  sprawling chase scenes — at the crowded Santa Anita racetrack and 
D  again at Dodger Stadium. The notion that a suspect can be tracked 
D  down, not once but twice, then spotted amid the vast throngs of a 
D  sporting event — well, it’s optimistic, to say the least.
D  </CW>The mood that [ITALIC]Secret in Their Eyes[/ITALIC] is going 
D  for, however, is anything but rosy. As the story works its way 
D  toward its twisty climax — an ending that hews closely to the one 
D  in Juan Jose Campanella’s original, [ITALIC]El Secreto de Sus 
D  Ojos[/ITALIC] — things get grim, indeed.
D  Too bad the audience can still be heard snickering merrily away.

D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Steven Rea
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER MOVIE CRITIC
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis Lacey, the Irish 
D  country girl at the heart of the magnificent and moving [/DROP3]
D  [ITALIC]Brooklyn[/ITALIC], with an intelligence and spirit that 
D  fills the screen and radiates beyond it. One of the most memorable 
D  characters of recent film, born from Colm Tóibín’s 2009 novel and 
D  brought to life via a screenplay by Nick Hornby and the smart, 
D  steady direction of John Crowley, Eilis is a young woman who faces 
D  a huge choice. She can stay in Enniscorthy, the County Wexford 
D  town where she has grown up and where, in truth, the future holds 
D  small promise. Or she can take a boat across the Atlantic, 
D  settling in the Irish precincts of early-1950s Brooklyn, where she 
D  knows not a soul, save for a parish priest who himself is an 
D  immigrant from Ireland.
D  The film’s title tells you which path Eilis takes. Full of dread, 
D  but with excitement, too — a whiff of freedom in the air — Eilis 
D  makes it through the lines at Ellis Island and across the East 
D  River. She takes a room in a boardinghouse for single women 
D  supervised by the amusingly stern Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters).
D  A job at a department store — where she is watched over by a 
D  gently admonishing Miss Fortini ([ITALIC]Mad Men’s[/ITALIC] 
D  Jessica Paré) — follows. So do night classes for an accounting 
D  degree (Eilis has a gift for numbers). And so does Antonio “Tony” 
D  Fiorello (Emory Cohen), a boyish fellow from a big Italian family. 
D  He’s a plumber, bouncy on his feet, beaming, and he falls for 
D  Eilis in a big way. Their courtship, with its church dances, bus 
D  rides, and movie-theater dates, has the innocence and charm of 
D  another, more decorous time.
D  Of course, it [ITALIC]is[/ITALIC] another time: big cars, bright 
D  colors, the elegant detail of even the most modestly priced 
D  dresses and suits. Slowly, shedding her initial homesickness, 
D  Eilis grows accustomed to it all. She moves with increasing ease 
D  to the city’s rhythms. She falls in love with Tony. She likes it 
D  here.
D  Then, just as everything is falling into place, a call from 
D  Ireland. A family crisis. Eilis has to go home to see her mother 
D  (Jane Brennan). She promises Tony she will return. But will she? 
D  Back in Enniscorthy, another suitor attends to Eilis with 
D  seriousness and care. As she walks along the beach with the 
D  upright and handsome Jim Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), the 
D  possibility of another life, a life that she once longed for, is 
D  belatedly offered. 
D  [ITALIC]Brooklyn [/ITALIC]takes place in that window between the 
D  end of World War II and the beginning of the seismic cultural 
D  shifts of the 1960s. The middle class was on the rise, creature 
D  comforts were in abundance<NO1>,<NO>; everything looked right with 
D  the world. And Eilis wants everything to be right in her world — 
D  but is it the new world, or the old?
D  [ITALIC]Brooklyn [/ITALIC]is that rare period drama that doesn’t 
D  lose itself in its dogged re-creation of another time. Yes, the 
D  film brims with romance and a certain nostalgia (or, if not 
D  nostalgia, an appreciation for the objects and customs of a bygone 
D  era). But at its very core is this woman, Eilis, whose journey 
D  remains as vital and meaningful now as it was back then.

D  country girl who travels to New York, in search of a new life.

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]Family secrets can be dangerous at the best of 
D  times: Repressed trauma doesn’t die when it’s buried. And like the 
D  vengeful ghost of Hamlet’s father, it always finds its way back to 
D  haunt the living.
D  All the more so if the family in question is headed by a scientist 
D  conducting mind-control experiments for the CIA.
D  That’s the premise of TV writer-producer Michael Z. Wechsler<NO1>
D  cq<NO>’s feature premiere, [/DROP3][ITALIC]Altered Minds[/ITALIC], 
D  a powerful, effective — if admittedly fanciful and contrived — 
D  psychological thriller starring Judd Hirsch as the gentle 
D  patriarch of a Philadelphia family who is confronted about his 
D  dark past by his grown children.
D  Hirsch, 80, best known for his beloved turn as the avuncular Alex 
D  Rieger in the sitcom [ITALIC]Taxi[/ITALIC], delivers a restrained, 
D  memorable performance as Nathaniel Shellner, a psychiatrist who 
D  worked for the military in the 1950s before joining the Peace 
D  Corps. He became renowned in the 1970s and 1980s for treating war 
D  orphans around the world who were affected by PTSD.
D  From his work also came three adopted children: Harry (C.S. Lee), 
D  a concert violinist born in Southeast Asia, and siblings Julie 
D  (Jaime Ray Newman) and Tommy (Ryan O’Nan), whom Nathan rescued 
D  from a Russian orphanage.
D  Long retired, Nathan and his wife, Lillian (Caroline Lagerfelt), 
D  have gathered together their children, including their biological 
D  son, Leonard (Joseph Lyle Taylor), at their beautiful suburban 
D  home for a last reunion before his impending death from lung 
D  cancer.
D  The tranquil weekend is rudely interrupted when Tommy, a horror 
D  novelist with a fertile, morbid imagination, accuses Nathan of 
D  having experimented on him as a child.
D  Tommy, who has been in therapy for years, is clearly nuts. He 
D  spends most of the day trying to dig up the family dog, which has 
D  been dead 20 years. He claims to have recovered memories of his 
D  father and colleagues’ implanting electrodes in his brain when he 
D  was 8.
D  There’s something, Tommy insists — a grave, a secret lab, a chest 
D  full of secret papers — underneath the garden. Julie then begins 
D  remembering a damp underground cell beneath the house, an armed 
D  soldier, the smell of rubbing alcohol. 
D  What’s going on here? Has she been infected by Tommy’s mind-rot, 
D  as Leonard insists? Or did something awful actually happen in that 
D  house?
D  A small, intimate micro-budget effort, [ITALIC]Altered 
D  Minds[/ITALIC] boasts terrific production values, pitch-perfect 
D  performances, and an eerie soundscape of found noises that evoke 
D  the feel of a surreal nightmare.
D  While it sometimes comes off like a staged play, it’s an 
D  impressive debut from a director in full control of the material.

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]It is perhaps no surprise to learn that matinee 
D  idol Tab Hunter, the clean-cut, clean-living boy-next-door who 
D  drove young female fans into fits of ecstasy, was a fabrication 
D  created by the Hollywood image machine.
D  No such man existed. Or could exist, as we learn from [/DROP3]
D  [ITALIC]Tab Hunter Confidential[/ITALIC], an engaging, if uneven, 
D  new film from the remarkably prolific documentarian Jeffrey 
D  Schwarz ([ITALIC]I am Divine[/ITALIC], [ITALIC]Vito[/ITALIC], 
D  [ITALIC]<NO1>//all one title the following:<NO>Spine Tingler! The 
D  William Castle Story[/ITALIC]).
D  Tab Hunter was the real-life fictional role foisted on a young, 
D  shy, gay New Yorker named Andrew Kelm. Born in 1931, he moved to 
D  California with his mother after she divorced his abusive dad.
D  Andrew, who after the divorce became Arthur Gelien (his mom’s 
D  maiden name), was transmogrified into Tab Hunter by Henry 
D  Willson<NO1>CQ two LLs<NO>, a star-maker, born in Lansdowne, Pa., 
D  and well-known in the movie business for representing some of the 
D  biggest male sex symbols of the 1950s, including Rock Hudson, Chad 
D  Everett, Robert Wagner, and Nick Adams.
D  Hunter, who has never been taken too seriously as a thespian, 
D  managed to gain celebrity status, starring in more than 40 films, 
D  including his best-known hit, 1958’s [ITALIC]Damn Yankees[/ITALIC]
D  . He also had a modest career as a crooner, landing several hit 
D  singles, including “Young Love” (1957) and “Jealous Heart” (1958). 
D  Hunter’s star waned in the 1960s. Moviegoers found his clean-cut 
D  shtick too tame, too old, too establishment.
D  [KERN-3]Based on Hunter’s 2006 tell-all memoir of the same name, 
D  [/KERN-3][KERN-2][ITALIC]Tab Hunter Confidential[/ITALIC] has the 
D  84-year-old Hunter present his own life story. His narrative is 
D  fleshed out with plenty of archival footage and peppered with 
D  brief interviews with some of Hunter’s costars, including Clint 
D  Eastwood, Debbie Reynolds, and Wagner.
D  [/KERN-2]The film isn’t as revealing as one might expect, 
D  especially when it comes to Hunter’s love life, although it does 
D  include some details about his secret relationship with Anthony 
D  Perkins.
D  Schwarz does try to distinguish [ITALIC]Tab Hunter 
D  Confidential[/ITALIC] from the run-of-the-mill celeb bios that 
D  crowd cable stations by taking a critical look at the process by 
D  which Willson and his colleagues created personas for their stars 
D  and micromanaged their personal lives to fit that image.
D  As he did with Hudson, Willson buried Hunter’s homosexuality under 
D  a blanket of publicity that had the rising star date some of the 
D  era’s most eligible ingenues, including Natalie Wood.
D  It’s refreshing to see an actor tell his own story with some real 
D  honesty. Overall, however, [ITALIC]Tab Hunter 
D  Confidential[/ITALIC] is too much like every other [ITALIC]
D  Hollywood True Story[/ITALIC] out there.

D  [/WEBTAGS][WEBHEAD]A great weekend for runners — and watchers
D  [/WEBHEAD]<NO>[BYLINE]By Natalie Pompilio
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]FOR THE INQUIRER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP5]Two types of people will flood Philadelphia this 
D  weekend: elite runners and the people who support them. Both can 
D  have a great time at the 22d Gore-Tex Philadelphia Marathon and 
D  Half Marathon — with the right planning.
D  [/DROP5]It’s easier for the more than 25,000 runners. They’ll 
D  enjoy a scenic course Sunday — either a full 26.2 miles or a 
D  slightly more reasonable (ha<NO1>!<NO>) 13.1 miles — that passes 
D  through such neighborhoods<NO1>,<NO> as Chinatown, Society Hill, 
D  University City, and Manayunk. They’ll be welcomed at the start 
D  line, celebrated at the finish, and applauded and inspired by the 
D  crowds at “cheer zones” throughout the course. 
D  The expected 60,000 spectators can cheer on their fleet-footed 
D  friends while also having a good time all their own. Fitness fans 
D  may choose to do a [ITALIC]Rocky[/ITALIC]-esque run up the steps 
D  of the Philadelphia Museum of Art<NO1> Museum<NO>, or<NO1> to<NO> 
D  strap on skates for a quick loop around the Rothman Institute Ice 
D  Rink at Dilworth Park. History hounds will find cheering points 
D  conveniently located near some of the city’s most popular 
D  attractions, including Independence Hall and the National 
D  Constitution Center. Those with more leisurely leanings will find 
D  plenty of eating, drinking, shopping, and sightseeing to fill the 
D  hours.
D  “Marathon weekend is special even if you’re a nonrunner,” said 
D  Mark Sullivan of Freeburg<NO1>cq Freesburg<NO>, <NO1>Pa.,<NO>
D  Snyder County, one of only two people<NO1> OTHER GUY BELOW<NO> who 
D  has run in every Philadelphia Marathon since its 1994 inaugural. 
D  “The city offers so much. There’s something for everyone.”
D  While the city has hosted an annual 26.2-mile race since 1954, the 
D  modern history of the Gore-Tex Philadelphia Marathon begins in 
D  <NO1>1994<NO>mid-1990s, when the city took over race management 
D  and designed a course entirely within city limits. There were 
D  1,500 runners in that first marathon; the half-marathon was added 
D  in 2006. The Gore-Tex Philadelphia Marathon is one of the 10 
D  largest races of its kind in the country and is a U<NO1>.<NO>S<NO1>
D  .<NO>A<NO1>.<NO> Track & Field-sanctioned event.
D  The marathon-based programing begins Friday with the Comcast 
D  Health & Fitness Expo at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. This 
D  free event, which is also open Saturday, is for athletes and couch 
D  potatoes alike and offers lectures and presentations on healthy 
D  topics, shopping, and exhibits, and has<NO1>add<NO> a dedicated 
D  area for children. Bob Koen, the only other person to run in every 
D  race since 1994, says he picks up his race number at the expo, 
D  then strolls around downtown.
D  “I love Philadelphia,” said Koen, of Audubon, N.J., who said that 
D  his son-in-law would also be running this year and that his 
D  daughter would be cheering them both on. “I like a lot of noise,” 
D  he said. “When you’re running and there are a lot of people, it 
D  really gets you charged up.”
D  Daytime Saturday will bring the annual Rothman Institute 8K and a 
D  Kids Fun Run that offers mile- and half-mile options. Saturday 
D  night will see carb-loading runners filling up restaurants 
D  throughout the area. (Sullivan, for example, will probably be at 
D  the Center City Maggiano’s.) 
D  While there is no continual television broadcast of the race 
D  Sunday, the course is very spectator-friendly, Sullivan said. 
D  Downtown, for example, spectators can see the runners at three 
D  locations within easy walking distance of each other. 
D  While there’s a buzz and energy near the race’s start line on the 
D  Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Sullivan said, he doesn’t recommend it 
D  as a vantage point if you’re there to support an individual 
D  runner.
D  “You can only get so close, and they get lost in the crowd. It’s a 
D  bunch of heads bobbing off into the distance.”
D  Instead, he recommends Logan Circle or a spot near City Hall, 
D  perhaps Broad and Arch Streets, as a good starting vantage point. 
D  From there, spectators can walk to Chestnut Street and catch their 
D  runners anywhere along that two-mile stretch. A quick hop back to 
D  the Art Museum allows watchers to see their runners at the halfway 
D  point.
D  “The runners will have thinned out,” he said, “and you can see 
D  your person, toss them a shirt or a fresh pair of gloves.” 
D  Other great p<CW-24>laces to cheer, Sullivan said, include 
D  Manayunk, which is always crowded with supporters, and near the 
D  Philadelphia Zoo, which offers a chance to amuse restless children 
D  while also supporting racers. 
D  </CW>Can’t make any of those locations? No problem, Sullivan said. 
D  You can’t buy a bad ticket for this show. In fact, you can’t buy a 
D  ticket at all. 
D  “This is an opportunity to watch a professional sporting event for 
D  free,” he said. “It’s citywide, and chances are there’s someplace 
D  near you where you can watch it.”

D  <NO1>[WEBHEAD]Coming pop shows: Flamin’ Groovies, Angel Haze, and 
D  Alex Bleeker & the Freaks
D  [/WEBHEAD][WEBTAGS]inqartsent,entertainment,music
D  [/WEBTAGS]timpane edit
D  <NO>[SUBHED_1]The Flamin’ Groovies
D  [/SUBHED_1]Although they emerged out of San Francisco in the 
D  mid-1960s, the Flamin’ Groovies had nothing to do with the 
D  hippie/psychedelic scene that came to define the city in those 
D  years. Instead, the Groovies slammed out gloriously unpretentious 
D  rock-and-roll with pop flair and proto-punk energy, proving they 
D  could be both bluesy and Beatlesque. It’s a timeless sound with 
D  influence that has far surpassed the band’s period of commercial 
D  success. Their reunion Friday at Johnny Brenda’s will feature 
D  three members of the 1971-80 lineup, which produced 1976’s great 
D  Dave Edmunds-produced [ITALIC]Shake Some Action[/ITALIC]: founding 
D  member Cyril Jordan on guitar and vocals; bassist George 
D  Alexander; and singer and guitarist Chris Wilson, who replaced 
D  original front man Roy Loney. In addition to old favorites such as 
D  “Shake Some Action,” “Teenage Head,” and “Jumpin’ in the Night,” 
D  expect to hear some new material — coming in 2016 is a new album 
D  as well as a documentary, [ITALIC]The Incredible Flamin’ 
D  Groovies[/ITALIC].[SIGNATURE]
D  <QM>— Nick Cristiano
D  [/SIGNATURE][SHIRTTAILNEW]The Flamin’ Groovies, with the Goodbye 
D  Party and Residuels<NO1> ((((cq))))<NO>, set to play at 8<TH>p.m. 
D  Friday<NO1>Nov20<NO> at Johnny Brenda’s, 1201 Frankford Ave. 
D  Tickets: $20. 215-739-9684<NO1>verified<NO>, johnnybrendas.com
D  [/SHIRTTAILNEW]<EM>
D  [SUBHED_1]Angel Haze
D  [/SUBHED_1]Angel Haze is one of the most alluring and dynamic 
D  female emcees in the game. You may have heard her outstanding riff 
D  on Eminem’s “Cleanin’ Out My Closet” or “Echelon (It’s My Way),” 
D  from her 2013 album, [ITALIC]Dirty Gold[/ITALIC]. A self-professed 
D  pansexual, the 23-year-old Detroit-cum-Brooklynite has a fire 
D  within found only in rappers such as Mykki Blanco, Danny Brown, 
D  Rye Rye, Heems, or Azealia Banks. Her flows flirt with 
D  consciousness, but her delivery is, at times, so rapid-fire that 
D  the lyrics get lost in the fury. Thankfully, on the recently 
D  released [ITALIC]Back to the Woods[/ITALIC], she's working with 
D  haunting, relentless, almost frighteningly compelling beats. On 
D  “Moonrise Kingdom,” the de facto first single off [ITALIC]
D  Woods[/ITALIC], she slows it down, sings, and injects loads of 
D  nuance into hip-hop that employs R&B, emo pop, and melancholic 
D  rock. Haze’s entire presentation is riveting and refreshing. 
D  [SIGNATURE]<QM>— Bill Chenevert
D  [/SIGNATURE][SHIRTTAILNEW]Angel Haze is to perform at 8<TH>p.m. 
D  Sunday<NO1>Nov22<NO> at Underground Arts, 1200 Callowhill St. 
D  Tickets: $15. Information: Undergroundarts.org<NO1>no phone 
D  available<NO>.
D  [/SHIRTTAILNEW][SUBHED_1]Alex Bleeker and the Freaks
D  [/SUBHED_1]The last few months have seen three solo albums from 
D  members of New Jersey’s Real Estate, the beloved indie guitar 
D  band. Leave it to the bass player to produce the outlier. Compared 
D  to the releases from guitarists Matt Mondanile ([ITALIC]St. 
D  Catherine[/ITALIC], by his band Ducktails) and Martin Courtney 
D  ([ITALIC]Many Moons[/ITALIC]), Alex Bleeker and the Freaks’ 
D  [ITALIC]Country Agenda [/ITALIC]is the most distant from Real 
D  Estate’s jangly neighborhood. Bleeker’s third album recalls 
D  mid-1960s roots-rock records such as the Grateful Dead’s [ITALIC]
D  American Beauty[/ITALIC] and the Band’s [ITALIC]Music from Big 
D  Pink[/ITALIC]: wistful, easygoing country rock, full of gently 
D  loping guitar solos and lead vocals shared among members of the 
D  quintet. [ITALIC]Country Agenda[/ITALIC] sounds communal and 
D  nostalgic and therefore inviting. Bleeker and company will let 
D  their freak flag fly Sunday night at Boot & Saddle.
D  [SIGNATURE]<QM>— Steve Klinge
D  [/SIGNATURE][SHIRTTAILNEW]Alex Bleeker and the Freaks, with the 
D  Extraordinaires, are to perform at 8<TH>p.m. Sunday<NO1>Nov22<NO> 
D  at Boot & Saddle, 1131 S. Broad St. Tickets: $10. Information:

D  <NO>[BYLINE]By A.D. Amorosi
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]FOR THE INQUIRER
D  [/BYCREDIT]<DC@1,3,41,0,0,0,0,0,2,88,100>S[KERN-1]ince 1990, when 
D  he played bass on albums by elder greats Roy Hargrove and Wallace 
D  Roney, Philadelphia’s leading bass man Christian McBride has been 
D  considered one of the finest craftsmen in jazz, whether jamming, 
D  collaborating, or composing. 
D  [/KERN-1]In 1998, McBride got the opportunity of a lifetime: a 
D  commission from Maine’s Portland Arts Society to compose a piece 
D  for Black History Month. The work, which is titled [ITALIC]The 
D  Movement Revisited[/ITALIC], concerns itself with African American 
D  themes and includes a choir. It comes to Philadelphia for the 
D  first time this weekend. 
D  </DC>So he composes choral works now? 
D  “I still don’t have much experience,” he says, holding back a 
D  laugh.
D  [KERN-3]Originally written for his quartet, a small gospel choir, 
D  and several narrative voices, [ITALIC]The Movement 
D  Revisited[/ITALIC] now has an additional chapter (“Apotheosis: 
D  November 4, 2008,” a tribute to the presidency of Barack Obama) 
D  that joins existing segments dedicated to civil-rights icons Rosa 
D  Parks, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and 
D  Muhammad Ali. McBride’s majestic music seeks to replicate the 
D  scope of their achievements, with an 18-piece ensemble, a large 
D  choir (the Philadelphia Heritage Chorale), and four narrators, 
D  including Philadelphia poet Sonia Sanchez. 
D  [/KERN-3]“My biggest challenges were to just get out of my own 
D  way,” McBride says. “That, and to try to enhance the spirit” of 
D  each icon’s familiar words. McBride’s music is peaceful and soft 
D  for Parks; loud, brash, and bold for Ali; serene and Coltranelike 
D  for Malcolm X; slow and grand for King.
D  [KERN-3]“I don’t want to predict anything, but the magnitude of 
D  the piece — why it was written, what it was about — I can’t 
D  imagine I’ll ever write something as monumental on this scale 
D  again,” he says<NO1>, before jokingly comparing his work to Wynton 
D  Marsalis’ many large orchestral works<NO>. <NO1>In 2016, McBride 
D  will be Harry Belafonte’s musical director for an as-yet 
D  #BlackLivesMatter concert at a place and in a time as yet to be 
D  determined).<NO>“I do get overwhelmed playing it, and every time I 
D  do, it feels new. Sometimes, I play this piece and still go, ‘Wow, 
D  did I really write this?’<TH>”
D  [/KERN-3][SHIRTTAILNEW]Christian McBride’s “The Movement 
D  Revisited” plays at 8<TH>p.m. Saturday<NO1>, November 21 at 8 p.m. 
D  <NO> at the Merriam Theater, 250 S. Broad St. Tickets: $29-$72.

D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]ARIES (March 21-April 19)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD][AGATE_LG] 
D  (<CF13><CW-200>ssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>*****<NO> You want to take 
D  another look at what might have been bothering you about a new 
D  acquaintance. Meanwhile, detach from the problem, go off, and 
D  enjoy yourself. You have more to your destiny than worrying about 
D  this or that. Yes, someone will suddenly spark up your days. 
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]TAURUS (April 20-May 20)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>sssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>*****<NO> What you believed was a 
D  given provides unanticipated magic. A close friend might be the 
D  source of an unusual bond or someone you are already relating to — 
D  little did you know their diversity, sincerity, and potential. Get 
D  ready to know another facet of this person.
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]GEMINI (May 21-June 20)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>ssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>****<NO> You like what you see, and 
D  you keep going by to check out “the view.” Do you think that maybe 
D  you are being a bit obvious? Make the approach, and offer 
D  friendship, and see the fireworks that might permeate your life as 
D  long as you hang with this person.
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]CANCER (June 21-July 22)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>ss</CF></CW>)<NO1>**<NO> You can rant, you can rave, but 
D  really, you are not into the situation or getting to know this 
D  person. Strap on your seat belt, and hold on tight. You might have 
D  taken someone for granted, and you will certainly find out. 
D  Meanwhile, make an effort to be interested. Please.
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]LEO (July 23-Aug. 22)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13><CW-200>
D  ssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>****<NO> One-to-one relating is the path to 
D  your weekend happiness. Nothing has to be heavy, nothing has to be 
D  overwhelming. Those feelings come from you, your depth. Recognize 
D  how much you care. You cannot walk away from this person easily.
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>ssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>****<NO> You might want to talk about 
D  what is on your mind. Rather, try to accept another person’s 
D  actions for what they are. Explaining, talking, and discussion are 
D  not the path at the moment. Go for the wild ride. Soon enough, 
D  your time will come.
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>sssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>*****<NO> Stop the flirting, and get 
D  to work. Literally. You have a lot of ground to cover today, and 
D  until then, you are no fun. The games will begin late this 
D  weekend. The quality of what goes on reflects how carefree you 
D  are. The wait for you to join will be worth it — just ask on 
D  Monday. 
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>sssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>*****<NO> You could dance to a new 
D  tune this weekend, if you let go tonight. You might be swept away 
D  by an intensity that is unique even for you. Give up being 
D  controlling, and go for the moment. You will discover that another 
D  wild child lies within that you have yet to meet. Talk about not 
D  knowing oneself.
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>sssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>*****<NO> My, my — you decide to head 
D  home and nestle in. Others — your friends — make a bet on how long 
D  that behavior will play out. The good news is at least you will be 
D  well rested when you decide to appear Saturday. You will make 
D  quite an entrance. 
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>ssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>****<NO> Head out now, move with 
D  quickness. You do not want to lose tonight. The remainder of the 
D  weekend will be a direct reflection of tonight. You might let go 
D  of the tried-and-true, at least for a short while. All will return 
D  to normal — maybe in a few days.
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>ssss</CF></CW>)<NO1>****<NO> Be gracious: Treat another 
D  person to munchies and TGIF. You like to see people happy and 
D  relaxed, and you will be the instrument that makes a friend 
D  finally smile. It has taken long enough, don’t you think? The real 
D  fun and flirtation begins Saturday. You’ll see and smile at the 
D  unexpected.
D  [AGAT_LG_BOLD]PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20)[/AGAT_LG_BOLD] (<CF13>
D  <CW-200>sss</CF></CW>)<NO1>***<NO> You beam in what you think you 
D  want. You might discover later that, no, you would like to back 
D  out. You will and then decide to go off and have a boring weekend. 
D  Otherwise, you could be in a tumultuous scene that goes on and on.

D  [ITALIC] Matilda[/ITALIC]<NO1>,<NO> is about a little girl with 
D  superpowers. That just about describes the winsome, hugely 
D  talented <NO1>cq/<NO>Mabel Tyler, who stars in the touring

D  one of three girls who alternate in the role.)<NO1>.<NO> She 
D  delivers complicated lyrics and dialogue — some of it in Russian — 
D  and leads, with real stage presence, a cast of many children and 
D  quite a few adults.[/KERN+3] 
D  The plot makes [ITALIC]Annie[/ITALIC]’s hard-knock life look like 
D  a walk in the park: Matilda is a brilliant little girl who is 
D  tormented by her awful parents (<NO1>cq/<NO>Cassie Silva and <NO1>
D  cq/<NO>Quinn Mattfeld). They send her to a school ruled by the 
D  hideous Miss Trunchbull (<NO1>cq/<NO>Bryce Ryness), who tortures 
D  the kids mercilessly. A sweet but timid teacher, Miss Honey 
D  (Jennifer Blood), is no match for these three mean adults whose 
D  vices — stupidity, vulgarity, and cruelty — seem to domina[KERN+3]
D  te the production as well as Matilda’s life. There is little joy 
D  to be found, even in the — wait for it, and wait, and wait — happy 
D  ending. The show arrives trailing clouds of critical glory from 
D  London; I am baffled.
D  [/KERN+3]Matilda’s chief offense is that she likes stories and 
D  loves to read. There is a librarian (Ora Jones) who reacts to 
D  Matilda’s storytelling as if she herself were a child, screaming 
D  and weeping. In these scenes, the set is especially hard to make 
D  sense of: Sometimes, actors appear, sometimes silhouettes appear 
D  behind a scrim. At one point, a bunch of shredded paper falls on 
D  us from above. None of this adds clarity or magic.
D  Much of the production’s problem is caused by the acoustics. 
D  Between the English accents and the over-mic’d voices, it is 
D  almost impossible to understand what anybody is saying or singing. 
D  Overheard at intermission: “If they don’t start speaking English, 
D  I’m leaving.” And a text message from elsewhere in the theater is 
D  read aloud: “Maybe it’ll get better in the second act.” 
D  [KERN+3]The children, adorable and hardworking as they are, have 
D  been directed to mug it up, overacting and showing off in ways 
D  that are embarrassing to watch. The grown-up actors are, 
D  apparently, equally helpless under <NO1>cq/<NO>Matthew Warchus’ 
D  direction.

D  [/WEBTAGS]<NO>[BYLINE]By Jim Rutter
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]FOR THE INQUIRER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]If you love[/DROP3][ITALIC] A Christmas 
D  Story[/ITALIC], the 1983 movie about Ralphie Parker and his 
D  holiday memories of his family and fourth-grade friends, the 
D  Walnut Street Theatre’s heartwarming production of the musical 
D  version will no doubt provide a new brand of syrup to enrich your 
D  schmaltzy enjoyment of the film.
D  If you hate the film, and it<NO1>’<NO>s maudlin, faux nostalgia 
D  that — through 24-hour cable marathons — has now become a parody 
D  of what it<NO1>’<NO>s originally gritty (yet admittedly warm) 
D  realism tried to spoof, well, the Walnut’s heartwarming production 
D  may enthrall you, as it did me for two hours on opening night.
D  It helps that Joseph Robinette’s book centers the plot on 
D  Ralphie’s (Craig Mulhern Jr.) quest to acquire his Red Ryder BB 
D  gun, and that Justin Paul and Friends Central grad <NO1>cq/<NO>
D  Benj Pasek’s music and lyrics add a filmic pep to each scene 
D  (particularly the winning “The Genius on Cleveland Street” and the 
D  western-themed “Ralphie to the Rescue” that scores Ralphie’s 
D  fantasies of saving his family with his rifle).
D  But it helps even more that director Ja[KERN-2]mes Rocco cast 
D  nothing but beautiful, endearing actors in all of the adult roles. 
D  This decision alone transforms the Old Man (Christopher Sutton) 
D  from a stern and fearsome father into a likable Everyman, 
D  particularly in Sutton’s ham-fisted performance. Mother (<NO1>
D  cq/<NO>Lyn Philistine) similarly evolves from the movie’s frazzled 
D  hausfrau to a cross between Stacy’s Mom and June Cleaver. 
D  Philistine accentuates her appeal with a warm portrayal and 
D  joyfully nostalgic rendition of “Just Like That.”
D  [/KERN-2]Casting the leggy <NO1>cq/<NO>Ellie Mooney as 
D  schoolteacher Miss Shields scores the triple-dog-dare-ya 
D  coup-de-grace of this show, with her sultry singing and skillful 
D  execution of choreographer Linda Goodrich’s tap number, adding a 
D  bit more adult content to Ralphie’s reminiscences (which Fran 
D  Prisco’s Santa amplifies in the department store scene).
D  As in the film, original writer Jean Shepherd (Bill Van Horn) 
D  narrates Ralphie’s inner life, here to a more comedic effect. A 
D  well-picked children’s chorus backs up Mulhern through his many 
D  numbers, which Douglas G. Lutz’s musical direction instills with a 
D  child’s natural confidence (rather than the whiny, doubting, 
D  nasally drone of the movie).
D  Hard-core fans of the film shouldn’t fret; all the clever scenes 
D  (the flagpole incident) and catchy quotes (“You’ll shoot your eye 
D  out,” etc.) still live in this version.
D  I hate to waste energy harping on a film that my relatives still 
D  force me to endure, but I just think that golden ages should be 
D  gilded. And the Walnut has done just that with Mary Folino’s 
D  bright costumes, a gorgeous cast, and the kind of feel-good 
D  singing and (mostly) family-friendly tradition that I would want 
D  to enjoy every holiday.

D  <NO>[BYLINE]By Nancy G. Heller
D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]FOR THE INQUIRER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]Wonderful, wonderful — and yet again — 
D  wonderful.<NO1>!<NO> Wednesday’s world premiere of [/DROP3][ITALIC]
D  Beasts[/ITALIC], an evening-length work made for BalletX by Nicolo 
D  Fonte, was so good, I wanted to see it again while it was still 
D  happening.
D  So what if the theme of the piece (that old chestnut about nature 
D  vs. nurture) was overly ambitious? And so what if a few extraneous 
D  elements (the stage smoke, for instance) quickly became annoying? 
D  [ITALIC]Beasts[/ITALIC] gives BalletX the<NO1>add<NO> choreography 
D  that is worthy of its 10 superlative dancers, allowing them to 
D  show off both their astonishing technique and their impressive 
D  stylistic and dramatic range.
D  During the preshow Q&A session, moderator Lisa Kraus commented on 
D  the “seamless transitions” between the various segments of Fonte’s 
D  new work. That’s true, and remarkable, since [ITALIC]
D  Beasts[/ITALIC] explores violence, sexuality, humor, and much 
D  more, set to a collage of music by artists from Ella Fitzgerald to 
D  Débussy. Yet, Fonte pulls it all together, with flattering 
D  costumes designed by Christine Darch, a versatile set from newly 
D  minted MacArthur “genius” Mimi Lien, and Drew Billiau’s innovative 
D  lighting.
D  [KERN+3]In the first part of [ITALIC]Beasts[/ITALIC], Fonte 
D  tackles nothing less than the story of human evolution, beginning 
D  with dancers crawling onstage as though emerging from the 
D  primordial ooze. The second act<NO1>Act II<NO> opens in a 
D  ballroom, with the dancers elegantly attired and alternating 
D  graceful, balletic movements with awkward, suspiciously 
D  animalistic postures and gestures. It’s hardly a new thought, that 
D  the veneer of so-called civilization is only skin-deep. But 
D  Fonte’s inventive and challenging choreography makes this point in 
D  a fresh and powerful way.
D  [/KERN+3][KERN+3]Some highlights from the evening: Chloe Felesina, 
D  poured into a sparkly, red evening gown and seducing, then 
D  destroying, four men; the stunning, emotionally wrenching solo by 
D  Richard Villaverde; and a gorgeous duet for Gary W. Jeter II and 
D  Zachary Kapeluck. What an impressive start to the company’s 10th 
D  anniversary season.
D  [/KERN+3][SHIRTTAILNEW]Additional performances at 8<TH>p.m. Friday 
D  and Saturday; 2<TH>p.m. Saturday and Sunday; 7<TH>p.m. Sunday at 
D  the Wilma Theater, 265 S. Broad St. Tickets: $25 to $45.

D  [/BYLINE][BYCREDIT]INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
D  [/BYCREDIT][DROP3]Everybody knows a princess. (Sometimes one is 
D  born to you, sometimes you marry one — sometimes both.)[/DROP3]
D  Based more on the 1939 Shirley Temple classic film than the great 
D  1905 novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, Alfonso Cuarón’s film [BOLD]
D  A Little Princess[/BOLD] is no fairy tale, but it is gorgeous. The 
D  1995 gem is unfortunately little known, but well worth a look for 
D  the Emmanuel Lubezki cinematography as well as the affecting story 
D  of a young aristocratic girl whose fortunes take a turn for the 
D  worse when her father is lost in World War I. 
D  <CW-30>Those of a certain age may be surprised to see Eleanor Bron 
D  (the ingenue of the Beatles’ [ITALIC]Help![/ITALIC]) as the cruel, 
D  mendacious school headmistress who forces the title character into 
D  indentured servitude. The film is rated G, and the mean are 
D  punished, and the nice rewarded — but the melodrama may be a bit 
D  too intense for tinier royals, who should probably stick to 
D  [ITALIC]Sofia the First[/ITALIC] for just a bit longer.
D  </CW>[SHIRTTAILNEW]2<TH>p.m. Saturday<NO1>11/21<NO> at the 
D  Colonial Theatre, 227 Bridge St., Phoenixville. Tickets: $9; $7
